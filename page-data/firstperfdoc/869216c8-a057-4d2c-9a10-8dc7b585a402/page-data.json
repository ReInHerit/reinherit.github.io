Mansion’s “breath” in a symbolic and abstract way. The different rooms and spaces were identified with the vital organs of a living organism. In this way, the viewer had a visual stimulus that completed his/her immersive experience.</p>\n<p>At first, it was needed to create an extensive visual collection of the museum’s data. We organized a professional photographic recording to be done on two separate days and we collected the following data:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Architecture (external and internal space)</li>\n<li>Perspectives and Details</li>\n<li>Vegetation/Nature in relation to the museum</li>\n<li>Objects</li>\n<li>Relationship between light and building (external and internal)</li>\n<li>Materials</li>\n<li>Textures</li>\n<li>Patterns</li>\n<li>Combined images of the above</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>- Step 2 - Study/Image Selection</strong></p>\n<p>At this stage, all the photographic material was studied. The most interesting images were distinguished and placed in separate folders.</p>\n<p><strong>- Step 3 - Visual Narration - Visual Structure</strong></p>\n<p>Beginning - Middle - End: 10 chapters as 10 different parts-locations-rooms of the building</p>\n<p><strong>- Step 4 - Cut out interesting elements</strong>  </p>\n<p><strong>- Step 5 - Material experimentation and animation</strong>  </p>\n<p><strong>- Step 6 - Creation of 10 different visual &#x26; moving chapters</strong>  </p>\n<p><strong>- Step 7 - Video Editing/Rhythm</strong>  </p>\n<p><strong>- Step 8 - Color Grade and Color correction</strong>  </p>\n<p><strong>- Step 9 - Final export</strong>  </p>\n<p><strong>- Step 10 - Projection Mapping</strong></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"2024-09-05T10:30:43.754Z","title":"Video Art","target_audience":["PROFESSIONAL"],"thumbnail":null,"type":"firstperfdoc","mainImage":null},"id":"3b5c1ec6-a193-57c6-9355-a169d423c269","excerpt":"Notes on video art created for ReInHerit in Performance: The Hadjigeorgakis Kornesios Mansion, by visual artist Stefanos Papadas During the…"}},"pageContext":{"id":"869216c8-a057-4d2c-9a10-8dc7b585a402"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
