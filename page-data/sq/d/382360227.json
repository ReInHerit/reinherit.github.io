Is the aim of the digital format to serve as a supplement to an on-site exhibition? If so, will it incorporate elements from the on-site exhibition or expand the content with additional materials? Will it be tied into the on-site exhibitions at certain points through links, QR codes or similar? Is it an independent venture altogether without an on-site counterpart? Should it be able to stand on its own without an analogue real-life exhibition? Who is the target audience? Questions of this nature are important in determining the structure, contents and mechanisms for digital online formats. </p>\n<p>In the case of ReInHerit, the Digital Exhibitions intend to be both a supplemental offer to the Travelling Exhibitions and an independent online format that does not require visitors to have seen the Travelling Exhibitions. The main element tying the Travelling and Digital Exhibitions together are the intro- and outro stations. These serve as a strategy to establish the thematic area of the exhibitions and give the visitors the opportunity to explore their relationship to it through a set of philosophical questions. In the on-site exhibitions, the intro- and outro stations are available on a screen at the entrance and exit of the exhibition space respectively. In correspondence to this, in the digital exhibitions, they are the first page that visitors navigate to when they enter each of the digital exhibitions. The outro station includes a statistical overview of collected answers from both Digital and Travelling Exhibitions. Thereby, the two formats are linked at this joint element. You can read more about the intro and outro stations in their own dedicated <a href=\"https://reinherit-hub.eu/exhibdoc/docintros/\">documentation article</a>.</p>\n<p>In terms of the arrangement of elements, the Digital Exhibitions are designed to make use of the digital space rather than simply transferring the structure of the Travelling Exhibitions to an online format. This is achieved primarily by emphasizing interactive content formats for introducing the objects of the exhibition. While the Travelling Exhibitions also emphasize interactive modalities, they are somewhat limited to the possibilities of the analogue space and the applications and presentation devices available in the exhibition spaces. This constraint does not apply to the online formats, which enables the Digital Exhibitions to employ a greater variety of interactive tools that are tailored to the object and the stories they tell. </p>\n<p>An essential decision for planning an online digital format is the choice of the platform it will be hosted on. Smaller museums might face challenges in this respect if they struggle with limited capacities and availabilities of online presence for their institutions. Ultimately, the choice of platform is influenced by a variety of questions ranging from budget considerations to structural decisions such as whether the digital format will be a standalone website or incorporated into an existing online presence. The hosting platform and architecture will also determine which kinds of content are feasible within the digital format.</p>\n<p>Finally, a crucial topic to consider in offline and online spaces alike is the question of accessibility. The web and online spaces should not be an exclusive space and must not become a space that disregards inclusivity and accessibility.  A useful reference for accessibility guidelines is the Web Accessibility Initiative.</p>","excerpt":"Developing a digital format usually begins with an assessment of what its intended goal will be.

This requires a decision for a storytelling tools framework that ideally allows for the creation of versatile and sustainably hostable interactive applications that can be incorporated into the chosen website architecture. The challenge in finding such a framework is often times linked to limited budgets and limited available frameworks that are useable at low- to no costs. Thankfully, there are some options that meet the specified criteria and are available to use for free (albeit with some constraints).<br>\nThe content framework chosen in the ReInHerit project is H5P. H5P is a versatile framework based on HTML5 and JavaScript. It offers a free version as well as a paid version that allows for even more diverse content options. Creating interactive activities with H5P is highly user friendly and the platform has a very active community, including a frequently updated forum. This makes it easy to use and quick to find support for any issues encountered along the way. The free version of the H5P platform offers the option of downloading the created content in the form of file packages that can be hosted locally. This makes it both cost effective and sustainable to use since the hosting of the content is not dependent on a third party platform. The download option is also available on the commercial platform H5P.com, which is also a viable option at a reasonable price for the extended set of features it offers. </p>\n<p>Once the storytelling tool framework is selected, the process can now move to selecting the individual tools for each object. This starts with exploring the content type options offered by the selected content framework and considering how they might be applied to the stories that will be told about the objects. The process of selecting a storytelling tool may follow a simple three-step process (as employed for the ReInHerit Digital Exhibitions).</p>","excerpt":"Having considered the basic questions around structure, content approaches, hosting and accessibility, the development of the digital format…","frontmatter":{"title":"4.

What elements does the story need? How can we translate the story elements into images, texts or audio elements? How can we visualize the story?</p>\n<p><strong>Step 3: Choose your Tool</strong></p>\n<p>Once you have come up with the visual elements you need for telling the story, look at the available tools in your framework and what they do. Which tool best suits your visualization? Try to imagine how the tool would look if you fill it with images, text or audio of your object. Remember that you can make use of videos, GIFs, animations etc. . Take a look at existing applications created with your toolset to get inspiration of what is possible. Then choose the tool best suited for telling your story.</p>\n<p>Once each object has been assigned to a suitable storytelling tool, it is time to prepare the needed files – such as images, videos, text, audio files etc. When all the content for the storytelling tools is completed, the elements are ready to be assembled.

The key is to keep up to date with free available online resources for interactive media creation and think creatively about traditional content types and the kinds of storytelling elements they can convey. Think about videos, GIFs, creatively arranged image slideshows, maps, text-based content etc. – how can you arrange these elements on a website in unexpected and innovative ways? How can you package information in them? Which of their qualities make them capable of conveying stories about your objects and subject matters? Think outside the box!</p>\n<p>Apart from storytelling tools, an exciting option for online content is incorporating 3D models in your online formats. This offers an innovative engagement modality for the viewers, as it almost mimics the possibility of touching and handling the object in real life – a possibility that not even traditional on-site exhibitions are able to deliver, as handling objects in an on-site exhibition is almost never allowed for the visitor. The most widely known platform for hosting 3D models is called Sketchfab. Sketchfab hosts 3D models and it offers an embeddable viewer that can easily be incorporated in any website. 3D models can also be annotated and thereby enriched with extra content via Sketchfab. The ReInHerit Digital Exhibitions offer embedded 3D models for each of the key objects where a 3D model was available. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/29a89c38-e01d-483b-8b7c-5bd4ac436158/\" alt=\"ReInHerit Digital Exhibitions interface\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/128ca1fc-6014-43b7-86d7-ba2e4019b45e/\" alt=\"ReInHerit Digital Exhibitions interface\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/b81d925d-888c-4708-bd89-79bbb6e4437b/\" alt=\"ReInHerit Digital Exhibitions interface\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/65ba6b5d-9227-4ca7-81cf-53661714af39/\" alt=\"ReInHerit Digital Exhibitions interface\"></p>","excerpt":"Step 1: Create the Story What story do you want to tell about your object?
