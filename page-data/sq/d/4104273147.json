A multitude of digital hubs, collections, and catalogues are already available online. Many museums, cultural heritage organizations, and other institutions are digitizing and publishing their collections and objects through various online channels. This begs the question: what is the need for another entry on the list of digital collections?</p>\n<p>The idea for the ReInHerit Digital Collection originated from the necessity for the traveling exhibitions to feature digital objects, which would need to be exchanged between the three partner museums. This decision to show digital objects was a main point in ReInHerit’s approach to a more sustainable traveling exhibition concept, as it eliminates the need for costly transports of real museum objects from one country to another. In thinking about these requirements, the ReInHerit team began to develop a concept for an online platform that would offer information and resources about a variety of objects from all over Europe to enable museums to choose suitable entries for their exhibition iterations. In the development process, the concept underwent some transformations. Among others, a key feature of the digital collection that was added to the requirements was to keep it open to submissions from cultural heritage institutions. This would ensure that the digital collection would have the potential to grow and be supplied with a multitude of objects and viewpoints from across Europe.</p>\n<p>An essential distinction from existing digital online collections, such as the Europeana collection is keeping the submission process simple while still collecting substantial information and creating an appealing user experience with the submitted object data. Submitting to the ReInHerit Digital Collection should be as achievable as possible for all institutions. Submissions are collected via a Google Form, which is included and explained in the next section. To make contributing even more accessible, the ReInHerit team produced a short video tutorial that shows the whole process from beginning to end.</p>\n<p>\n        <div class=\"embedVideo-container\">\n            <iframe\n              title=\"\"\n              width=\"560\"\n              height=\"316\"\n              src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uR1JFcP8wUQ?rel=0\"\n              class=\"embedVideo-iframe\"\n              style=\"border:0\"\n              \n              loading=\"eager\"\n              allowfullscreen\n\t      sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups\"\n            ></iframe>\n        </div></p>\n<p>Another important focus of the ReInHerit Digital Collection is the ability to directly a 3D object for every entry. 3D models are currently becoming more common in the Cultural Heritage space due to the increased accessibility of methods and tools for creating them. It was therefore an essential task for the developers of the ReInHerit Digital Collection to incorporate a 3D viewer into the page layout. Learn more about this and other technical and design-oriented features and functions of the ReInHerit Digital Collection in the next section.</p>","excerpt":"The online cultural heritage space is rapidly growing.

Why Create a Digital Collection?","date":"7 months ago","target_audience":["PROFESSIONAL"],"pageId":"8123ca3d-bbee-4d61-9f5f-1c35bb947534","license":"CC BY 2.0","thumbnail":null,"mainImage":null,"exhibdocsection":"Online Collection"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p>The collaborative element of the ReInHerit Digital Collection is one of its key characteristics. To facilitate a simple and low-barrier submission process, the submissions are collected via a Google Form. In developing the structure and content of the form, the ReInHerit team faced some challenges, which will be discussed in this section.</p>\n<p>The first step in creating the submission form was to consider the planned functions of the digital collection. The data collected via the form would have to allow for the Digital Collection to query the entries and use the files and data to create the desired representations on the finished web page. The ReInHerit team therefore collected all planned functions and created the Google Form questions in such a way that all the necessary data would be collected.</p>\n<p>In addition to the usual basic information about the objects – such as dimensions, materials, object title, artist's name etc. – the Google Form also asks submitters to select one of three thematic areas with which the object aligns. These thematic areas are the same as the thematic areas of the three travelling exhibitions – conflicts, craftsmanship and identities. Moreover, each of the partner museums created ten tags – that is, keywords – which allow for further categorizations of each object. The tags have been developed within each partner museum’s thematic area and are intended to provide further context for each digital collection entry, as well as allowing further filtering options. These categorizations serve the purpose of creating filtering systems in the digital collection. More information on the filtering system is provided in the next section.</p>\n<p>One challenge in creating the form was to determine an appropriate format for categorizing the period of origin. The period of origin of the objects contributed by each of the three partner museums spanned an extensive time period, which posed the problem of determining time span categories that would reflect the wide range present in the submissions, while remaining clear and not overwhelming for the submitters, and allowing for relatively meaningful and informative categorizations. The time period categories that were ultimately chosen can be viewed in the Google form below.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/ed3dbd75-b9c9-4056-8ae0-732f2eec1f7f/\" alt=\"Google Forms Time Periods\"></p>\n<p>The form also asks submitters to enter the coordinates for the object’s current location. This serves the purpose of creating map location markings as another filtering option for the digital collection. To determine the coordinates, submitters are directed to a website that provides location data based on an entered address. Asking for the current location information also serves the purpose of reflecting when objects are not physically held at the same location as the submitting institution’s address.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the question of submitting image files and 3D models needed to be resolved. Although Google Forms provide an option of submitting files directly in the form, enabling this option uses cloud space storage inside the account that is used to create the form and requires the submitter to have an active Google account. Additionally, the submission of 3D files would have meant using an even larger amount of cloud storage space and dealing with multiple file formats, as there is not yet a definitive file format standard that is universally used for 3D models. The ReInHerit team therefore decided to outsource the image and 3D file submissions by asking submitters to send their image files via WeTransfer or an equivalent file sending service, and asking to upload 3D models to Sketchfab and providing the respective links to both in the form. This eliminated the need for large cloud storage space and complicated file management.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/d5fbc366-d23c-4ca0-9c3f-546f98d56998/\" alt=\"Google Form 3D Submissions \"></p>\n<p>Finally, the form needed to ensure that copyright issues were resolved for submitted data.  Submitters are asked to select one of the provided Creative Commons license models for their submitted object in the form and are asked for consent to use the files in the ReInHerit digital infrastructure as well as outside of this infrastructure separately. Submitters have the option of denying consent to use their submitted objects in advertising. They are also required to confirm that their submitted data is accurate and in accordance with the object’s copyright status.</p>\n<p>Learn more about the functions and technical background of the Digital Collection in the next sections.</p>","excerpt":"The collaborative element of the ReInHerit Digital Collection is one of its key characteristics.

The order of the objects randomly changes every time the page is reloaded. This ensures that all submitted objects get an equal level of exposure, and no one object is advantaged or disadvantaged in this regard by a fixed position in the displaying order. Moving the mouse over the image reveals a text box with the title of the object, as well as a short teaser text about the object’s background and a button linking to the respective object’s detail page. In the detail page, there is a longer text about the object, information about the object’s size, origin time, the artist or producer, the materials, as well as a link to the submitting institution’s website. For submissions that featured a 3D model, the object detail page features an embedded 3D viewer window from Sketchfab. The 3D viewer window is omitted when the submission only features a 2D image. In this case, a simple 2D viewer allows viewers to open the image in an overlay window, zoom in and rotate the image. This 2D viewer is featured for all entries. The bottom of the object detail page shows the Creative Commons license of the object, as well as the selected thematic area, the selected tags for the object and a link to the corresponding thematic area’s digital exhibition. The intention behind this is to generate more traffic to the digital exhibitions, as well as offering interested viewers more background on the thematic area. Clicking on each of the object’s tags also takes the visitors to a filtered view of the digital collection, which shows all entries with the same tag.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/645d7292-cccc-4f34-bf94-1f03c61bd62d/\" alt=\"Digital Collection Overview\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/4f51b386-a116-44b1-b55f-c6cce63438ce/\" alt=\"Digital Collection Object View \"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/09e6aecc-b529-40f1-9686-69226b17b124/\" alt=\"Digital Collection 3D View\"></p>\n<p>Back on the Digital Collection main page, in the top right, there are three main filtering options. The first filtering option is the filter for the Thematic Areas. Selecting one or more of the Thematic Area options filters the collection of entries submitted under the respective Thematic Area. Clicking on a filter option activates the filter, which is shown by the button turning from white to black, deactivating the filter works by clicking on the button again. The next filtering option filters for Categories. These categories correspond to the tags selected for the object in the submission process. There are currently thirty tag options, ten from each of the thematic areas. The Category filters work just like the Thematic Area filters and can be combined with each other and the Thematic Area filters, allowing for a large combination of filtering options. The final filtering option is the Locations filter. Clicking on the Locations filter takes the visitors to a map, which shows existing Digital Collection entries at their geographical location marked by coloured boxes. The colours correspond to the Thematic Areas to which the objects belong. The location information is taken from the submissions form, where the current location of the object is asked. In this map view, clicking on the boxes reveals a preview window of the object, featuring its title, the photo, the Thematic Area tag and the “see more” button, which links to the object detail page introduced above. The map view can be closed via a black X on the top right of the page.  </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/47b26c2b-4910-4852-86dc-b9bf030d48e9/\" alt=\"Digital Collection Categories\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/c4047b0f-20f9-4ec6-9612-8d8eb697d6b8/\" alt=\"Digital Collection Location Filter \"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/e107c6dc-4ba4-447d-9762-29afb7a33942/\" alt=\"Digital Collection Map View \"></p>\n<p>Returning again to the main page, on the top right, there is a page menu indicated by three horizontal stripes in the yellow header bar.
