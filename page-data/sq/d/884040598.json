Narration and storytelling can take different forms. The development and presentation of an exhibition, the design of an educational programme for children, guided tours and books all are based on narration and storytelling techniques. These techniques unfold the interesting story of different objects of a museum, revealing their origin and new context within the museum they are placed in. This webinar aims at presenting the key uses of narration and storytelling in a museum context in relation to different museum activities, also featuring case studies and examples from the Museum of Cycladic Art in Athens, Greece. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/e7d59838-09e7-4075-8191-eb508cfc82eb/\" alt=\"Narration in the museum context: when objects narrate their unique stories\" title=\"Narration in the museum context: when objects narrate their unique stories\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/e6fbce62-84dd-487a-b83b-6eaa3fba0738/\" alt=\"Narration in the museum context: when objects narrate their unique stories\" title=\"Narration in the museum context: when objects narrate their unique stories\"></p>\n<h3>Speakers:</h3>\n<p><strong>Nefeli Bantela</strong> has studied English and Greek Language and Literature at the University of Athens.

Have you heard of prototyping in museums?</p>\n<p>Nowadays museums are increasingly seen as places of experience and dialogue. They are multi-voiced, story-oriented, open for provocation and reflection. To stay relevant and engaging museums need to innovate and have a visitor-centred approach. Developing new services and products that appeal to your visitors is vital to retain and increase visitor volumes, whilst enabling a meaningful experience. Oftentimes, though, a lack of resources is a hindrance. Development work is regarded as expensive but, is it really? This is where co-creation comes into the picture. In an environment of change and reflection co-creation is an apt, and surprisingly affordable tool to use when developing new museum products and services. </p>\n<p>The aim of this webinar is to delve into how co-creation can be used in developing permanent and temporary exhibitions. A particular focus will be on the usefulness of prototyping as a vital part of the co-creation process. Why is it useful to prototype? What do museums gain from engaging in prototyping? What do you need to start prototyping?</p>\n<p>Concept and Experience Designer Ines Montalvao will provide answers to these questions and tell us stories about co-creation processes she has been working on in museums around the world.

In particular, the ‘Smart Tourism’ framework of the European Commission - Directorate-General for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs (DG GROW) will be presented as well as the ‘Smart Destinations’ initiative of the United Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO). Smart tourism as defined by the EC responds to new challenges and demands in a fast-changing sector, including the evolution of digital tools, products, and services; equal opportunity and access for all visitors; sustainable development of the local area; and support to creative industries, local talent and heritage.  Smart Tourism is thus closely related to cultural heritage with digitalisation in sustainable cultural tourism development and promotion. The new ‘European Capital of Smart Tourism Award’ since 2019 has components of ‘Sustainability, Accessibility, Digitalisation, Cultural Heritage and Creativity’. Cultural Heritage aspects are about protecting and capitalising on the cultural heritage, as well as local potential and its creative assets. A smart destination according to UNWTO is one with a strategy for technology, innovation, sustainability, accessibility, and inclusivity, along the entire tourism cycle: before, during and after the trip. The pillars that comprise a smart destination thus include sustainability, innovation, and technology, which are closely related to the scope of the ‘ReInHerit’ Horizon2020 Coordination and Support Action (CSA).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/afdcb64b-65bd-492a-9707-67ebb20be632/\" alt=\"Smart Tourism - Smart Destinations: Cultural Heritage, Digitalisation and Sustainability aspects\" title=\"Smart Tourism - Smart Destinations: Cultural Heritage, Digitalisation and Sustainability aspects\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/0aef9101-bb45-4d15-bac4-bd1605c5674a/\" alt=\"Smart Tourism - Smart Destinations: Cultural Heritage, Digitalisation and Sustainability aspects\" title=\"Smart Tourism - Smart Destinations: Cultural Heritage, Digitalisation and Sustainability aspects\"></p>\n<h3>Speakers:</h3>\n<p><strong>Manos Vougioukas</strong><br>\nis Secretary-General of the European Cultural Tourism Network (ECTN), the only pan-European Network that brings together the cultural, heritage and tourism sectors to work together for sustainable cultural tourism development and promotion.
