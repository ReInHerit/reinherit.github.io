The prevalence of mental and physical chronic diseases is increasing globally. In addition, the changing demographics towards an aging population pose a challenge to health care systems since aging is associated with a decrease in physical and mental capacity and an increased risk of developing disease. Museums may be integrated into the lifestyle of patients suffering from chronic conditions due to their value in offering non-pharmacological therapeutic methods to improve the patient's experience with disease. The interactive environment of museums may have positive health outcomes not only for patients with chronic diseases but also for improving the physical and mental wellbeing of elderly and younger populations. This webinar explores recent literature investigating the effects of art-based museum interventions on (a) patients with chronic diagnoses associated with mental health and/or physical impairment such as dementia, drug addiction and cancer, (b) hospitalised patients and (b) the wellbeing of young and elderly populations.  During the webinar recent studies will be discussed which provide evidence that museum art-based interventions may be integrated as part of the non-pharmacological management of patients suffering from chronic disorders and hospitalised patients as well as for improving the wellbeing of younger and elderly populations.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/c48169a0-f924-4c41-8465-f04168cb7b1a/\" alt=\"Reinventing museums and their evolving role in physical and mental wellbeing\" title=\"Reinventing museums and their evolving role in physical and mental wellbeing\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/a9846fe6-5973-4b68-b970-13f939799760/\" alt=\"Reinventing museums and their evolving role in physical and mental wellbeing\" title=\"Reinventing museums and their evolving role in physical and mental wellbeing\"></p>\n<h3>Speakers:</h3>\n<p><strong>Dr Ioanna Hadjicosti -</strong> Director of the Bank of Cyprus Cultural Foundation and Coordinator of ReInherit H2020.She graduated from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece, with the BA in Greek Philology and the specialization of Classics.

Compassion feeds creativity, learning and well-being, which in turn contributes to a sustainable competitive advantage. An organization that encourages acts of compassion has a positive impact on innovation, collaboration, retention of staff and customers and willingness to change.</p>\n<p>Still, we know that acts of compassion are rare. In this webinar we will talk about the myths that prevent us from acting compassionately and share stories from our work and research that show how, in fact, it is difficult and even rebellious to act compassionately because if often requires that norms or conventions are broken.</p>\n<p>At its core, compassion is the ability to empathize with the suffering and struggles of others, coupled with a genuine desire to alleviate their pain. Ultimately, compassion is a rebellious act because it challenges the dominant paradigms and invites us to envision a more just world. It is a call to action, urging us to step outside the confines of societal expectations and prioritize the well-being of others.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/c3b8b906-cfac-4b01-846b-74ad9f779750/\" alt=\" Compassion is a Rebellious Act\" title=\" Compassion is a Rebellious Act\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/bac099cf-0fef-439c-a355-fc58b8e57570/\" alt=\" Compassion is a Rebellious Act\" title=\" Compassion is a Rebellious Act\"></p>\n<h3>Speakers:</h3>\n<p><strong>Henrika Franck</strong> <br>\n<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/henrika-franck-711aa83/\">Henrika Franck</a> is Dean of the Graduate School and Research at Arcada UAS and affiliated professor at Åbo Akademi University and Aalto University in Helsinki.

Have you heard of prototyping in museums?</p>\n<p>Nowadays museums are increasingly seen as places of experience and dialogue. They are multi-voiced, story-oriented, open for provocation and reflection. To stay relevant and engaging museums need to innovate and have a visitor-centred approach. Developing new services and products that appeal to your visitors is vital to retain and increase visitor volumes, whilst enabling a meaningful experience. Oftentimes, though, a lack of resources is a hindrance. Development work is regarded as expensive but, is it really? This is where co-creation comes into the picture. In an environment of change and reflection co-creation is an apt, and surprisingly affordable tool to use when developing new museum products and services. </p>\n<p>The aim of this webinar is to delve into how co-creation can be used in developing permanent and temporary exhibitions. A particular focus will be on the usefulness of prototyping as a vital part of the co-creation process. Why is it useful to prototype? What do museums gain from engaging in prototyping? What do you need to start prototyping?</p>\n<p>Concept and Experience Designer Ines Montalvao will provide answers to these questions and tell us stories about co-creation processes she has been working on in museums around the world.

In recent years, the technology has become increasingly easy to access and use even for people who do not have a background in imaging technology. It holds potential for museums and Cultural Heritage institutions who are interested in exploring new ways of digitizing, preserving, exploring and exhibiting Cultural Heritage objects while working with a limited budget. The webinar discusses the basic photogrammetry process by showing hands-on example cases. It will focus on the technical requirements and challenges in creating 3D models with photogrammetry, with a special focus on potential issues in working with Cultural heritage objects.

Smart tourism as defined by the EC responds to new challenges and demands in a fast-changing sector, including the evolution of digital tools, products, and services; equal opportunity and access for all visitors; sustainable development of the local area; and support to creative industries, local talent and heritage.  Smart Tourism is thus closely related to cultural heritage with digitalisation in sustainable cultural tourism development and promotion. The new ‘European Capital of Smart Tourism Award’ since 2019 has components of ‘Sustainability, Accessibility, Digitalisation, Cultural Heritage and Creativity’. Cultural Heritage aspects are about protecting and capitalising on the cultural heritage, as well as local potential and its creative assets. A smart destination according to UNWTO is one with a strategy for technology, innovation, sustainability, accessibility, and inclusivity, along the entire tourism cycle: before, during and after the trip. The pillars that comprise a smart destination thus include sustainability, innovation, and technology, which are closely related to the scope of the ‘ReInHerit’ Horizon2020 Coordination and Support Action (CSA).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/afdcb64b-65bd-492a-9707-67ebb20be632/\" alt=\"Smart Tourism - Smart Destinations: Cultural Heritage, Digitalisation and Sustainability aspects\" title=\"Smart Tourism - Smart Destinations: Cultural Heritage, Digitalisation and Sustainability aspects\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/0aef9101-bb45-4d15-bac4-bd1605c5674a/\" alt=\"Smart Tourism - Smart Destinations: Cultural Heritage, Digitalisation and Sustainability aspects\" title=\"Smart Tourism - Smart Destinations: Cultural Heritage, Digitalisation and Sustainability aspects\"></p>\n<h3>Speakers:</h3>\n<p><strong>Manos Vougioukas</strong><br>\nis Secretary-General of the European Cultural Tourism Network (ECTN), the only pan-European Network that brings together the cultural, heritage and tourism sectors to work together for sustainable cultural tourism development and promotion.

The goal of “Strike a Pose” and “Face Fit” applications is to challenge the users to analyze and replicate artworks with their own body and face, obtaining information about the replicated artworks and personalized representations that can be shared on social networks.  A gamification approach is useful both for improving the skills and competencies of museum professionals and for engaging visitors in museum content through the design of playful and participative digital learning scenarios in a \"play and interact\" visiting style. In the presentation will be analyzed the technical requirements needed to develop this type of applications and the computer vision techniques needed to implement this type of interaction.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/d789b131-034b-452c-8ab7-185133847619/\" alt=\"Engaging Museum Visitors with Gamification Apps\" title=\"Engaging Museum Visitors with Gamification Apps\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/efbc8823-2192-4000-86f8-963135b8d4e9/\" alt=\"Engaging Museum Visitors with Gamification Apps\" title=\"Engaging Museum Visitors with Gamification Apps\"></p>\n<h3>Speaker:</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.micc.unifi.it/people/marco-bertini/\">Marco Bertini</a> is Associate Professor in Computer Science at the University of Florence, Italy.
