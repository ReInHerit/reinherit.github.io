The Hub collects and presents all the project outputs, hosts a variety of training material and resources documenting our technological applications, and it aims to serve as a knowledge base and meeting point for professionals working across cultural heritage, cultural tourism, and new technologies.</p>\n<p><strong>Who is behind the Digital Hub?</strong></p>\n<p>You can find <a href=\"/about/12654fad-79d5-4c78-99a1-dd6d4b777cb1\">here</a> the members of the ReInHerit consortium. The team at the University of Graz, Department of Digital Humanities is responsible for the development of the Digital Hub infrastructure.</p>\n<p><strong>Can I contribute to the ReInHerit Digital Hub and how?</strong></p>\n<p>Sure! We are happy to welcome contributions from the community! If you are interested, please get in touch via the email (you find it at the footer of this page) or by contacting directly the team at the University of Graz. We will be in touch to support you in sharing your content and we will review it before publication.</p>\n<p><strong>Is there a networking possibility?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, the <a href=\"/forum\">ReInHerit Forum</a> aims to support networking around themes of common interest for the community. Feel free to join and participate in our regular chats!</p>\n<p><strong>Is there also an official project website?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes - while the Hub presents the results of our work, you can remain updated also via the <a href=\"https://www.reinherit.eu/\">project webiste</a>, and the newsletter you find there.  </p>\n<p> <strong>I am trying to upload new content on the Hub, how can I get more information on the workflow?</strong></p>\n<p>You find a first practical and short introduction in the <a href=\"/doc\">manual for contributors </a>. If you are encountering other problems please contact the team at the University of Graz.</p>\n<p><strong>I uploaded an image, but the size seems wrong. What should I do?</strong></p>\n<p>It is likely that your image is bigger than the set limit for image uploads or with incorrect proportions. If so you can either resize the image or ask the team at the University of Graz to allow special conditions for images in your Hub area.</p>\n<p><strong>Can I save a CMS entry as draft?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, on the top of each CMS entry you might enable/disable \"draft\" status for your content via a toggle element (in most cases).</p>\n<p><strong>Why is my content not immediately visible in the Hub?</strong></p>\n<p>The Digital Hub is a static website, which needs to be regenerated for every new item of content. This process is controlled by the Hub admins, who perform a quality check on the content before regenerating and redeploying the new posts.  Usually, we aim to check any new content and publish it twice a week - but if you need to work with a different timeline, you can agree a specific date with the team at the University of Graz.</p>\n<p>            Usually, we aim to check any new content and publish it twice a week - but if you need to work with a different timeline, you</p>\n<p>            can agree a specific date with the team at the University of Graz.</p>","excerpt":"What is the ReInHerit Digital Hub?

A viewer might read content on the Digital Hub, which is all offered with open licenses (Creative Commons licenses).

Authentication is done via the forum platform (Zulip) based on an email or a social media account.

The only information publicly available will be the username in the forum and - if the users choses to add one - the profile photo.</p>\n<p><strong>Community admin</strong></p>\n<p>A community admin is an authenticated user with verified identity, who participates in the forum and has admin rights on it.

The GitHub username of a Hub contributor needs to be added by an Hub Admin to the ReInHerit GitHub team. Subsequently, a Hub contributor has full access to the Digital Hub Content Management System (CMS) and is therefore able to add and edit content.

In general, the Hub follows the JAM-stack (Javascript, APIs, and Markup) architectural approach.</p>\n<h3>Technologies</h3>\n<p>The open source static site generator <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.com/\">Gatsby JS</a> was chosen as the main framework for the Hub. Gatsby uses React and GraphQL, enabling the querying of the data and the development of the different site components. In order to facilitate the addition of content by the project partners, Gatsby was paired with <a href=\"https://decapcms.org/\">Decap CMS</a> (formerly Netlify CMS),           an open source content manangement system facilitating the creation of entries for the website through an user-friendly interface. The Hub is hosted on GitHub and it integrates therefore GitHub oauth for the login into Netlify.</p>\n<p>Additional functionalities are provided by Upload Care, to support media files, and by Zulip, supporting forum and chatting possibilities.</p>\n<h3>Content-related workflows</h3>\n<p>Once authorised, contributors can login into the Netlify CMS and add material to the Digital Hub. Each of the content in ReInHerit had specific requirements (analysed in Deliverable 4.1) and received a customised template and query functionalities within the Hub. On the backend, this means that different (markdown based) models for the individual outputs are being used to render different views on the public interface through templates (also exploiting GraphQL queries functionalities).</p>\n<p>As a rule, the design has been kept consistent across the Hub - with the exception of the digital exhibitions - and links across the different sections (e.g. webinars and apps documentation) are offered whenever possible.</p>","excerpt":"The ReInHerit's Digital Hub is a static website, coded in React, and generated with Gatsby.
