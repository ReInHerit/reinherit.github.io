The school was held in the <a href=\"https://ctematera.it\">House of Technology</a> in Matera and was organized with the support of <a href=\"https://www.materahub.com\"><strong>MateraHUB</strong>.</a></p>\n<p>In the context of the School, a <strong>creative hackathon</strong> was organised where young PhD students worked in an <strong>interdisciplinary</strong> way on web apps re-using open-source codes shared in the ReInherit Digital Hub.  In collaboration with particular multidisciplinary experts, apps from the <strong>Reinherit Toolkit were co-created, tested and redesigned,</strong> working on the codes, user experience, graphical user interface and application scenarios in museum contexts.</p>\n<p>In addition to these workshop activities, <strong>international</strong> <strong>speakers</strong> and <strong>famous experts</strong> debated and engaged with students and researchers with different educational content and skills, and from different international countries: the United Arab Emirates to Saudi Arabia, from Sweden to the Netherlands, from Spain to Italy. The heterogeneous training of the participants covers different disciplines such as Robotics, Serious Games, Artificial Intelligence and Extended Reality, Digital Humanities, Interaction Design and Museum and Cultural Heritage Studies.  They lectured on different topics and applications of AI/XR in different contexts including museums and cultural heritage.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/fc989538-123b-4576-8578-a1a77f8a6a57/\" alt=\"XR&#x26;AI Summer School 2023 - ReInHerit Hackathon \" title=\"XR&#x26;AI Summer School 2023 - ReInHerit Hackathon \"></p>\n<p><strong>Marco Bertini</strong> and <strong>Paolo Mazzanti</strong> from <a href=\"http://www.micc.unifi.it\">MICC </a>- University of Florence presented a practical lecture on '<strong><em>Innovative and sustainable approaches for user engagement and digital interaction with cultural heritage'</em>.</strong> Adopting a sustainable and user-centred approach, the aim was to share relevant results of the playful approach and user engagement studies conducted within the <strong>ReInHerit H2020 research project</strong>. Cutting-edge applications based on artificial intelligence developed by the Media Integration and Communication Centre were presented to inspire the students' project proposals.

The project proposal, entitled 'AIFOCUS', aims to merge the chatbot 'VIOLA' and the Smart Lens to create an interactive art experience that provides insights into artworks through conversation. Users can explore artworks using the smartphone camera, exploring details through the enjoyment of multimedia content. The aim is to promote knowledge among young people and trigger their curiosity about art, making learning an engaging and accessible activity for all. Users have the possibility to scan the specific details they like to explore with their smartphone camera. Once the web application is opened, users can explore and discover the complexities of the artwork. They can also initiate a conversation with the chatbot, which provides answers about the scanned details. As a case study adapted to the local context, the Matera Cathedral nativity scene was chosen.</p>\n<p>During the hackathon, professionals and experts were invited <a href=\"https://reinherit.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/395690-XR.26AI-Summer-School-2023\">to chat  via  the Digital Hub Forum</a> to support students as they work, answering questions and sharing ideas and suggestions in a co-creative and interdisciplinary approach.</p>\n<p>________________________________________</p>\n<h3>VIOLA Multimedia Chatbot video presentation:</h3>\n<p>\n        <div class=\"embedVideo-container\">\n            <iframe\n              title=\"\"\n              width=\"560\"\n              height=\"316\"\n              src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BjstSqyxbOg?rel=0\"\n              class=\"embedVideo-iframe\"\n              style=\"border:0\"\n              \n              loading=\"eager\"\n              allowfullscreen\n\t      sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups\"\n            ></iframe>\n        </div></p>\n<h3>SmartLens video presentation:</h3>\n<p>\n        <div class=\"embedVideo-container\">\n            <iframe\n              title=\"\"\n              width=\"560\"\n              height=\"316\"\n              src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ySTcIsiZkao?rel=0\"\n              class=\"embedVideo-iframe\"\n              style=\"border:0\"\n              \n              loading=\"eager\"\n              allowfullscreen\n\t      sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups\"\n            ></iframe>\n        </div></p>","excerpt":"Project Proposal: AIFOCUS Smart Interaction and Digital Contents (AI/CV) | SmartLens & VIOLA Multimedia Chatbot Smart Lens and VIOLA…","frontmatter":{"pageId":"314ed627-6f30-4d43-9428-4e55aee28066","title":"AIFOCUS | ReInHerit Hackathon","theme":"Technology","date":"3 months ago","target_audience":["VISITOR","PROFESSIONAL"],"thumbnail":"https://ucarecdn.com/5f63db77-7f5b-40ac-a40a-f145b6d81111/","iframesrc_one":null,"iframesrc_two":null,"iframesrc_three":null}}},{"node":{"html":"<p>\n        <div class=\"embedVideo-container\">\n            <iframe\n              title=\"\"\n              width=\"560\"\n              height=\"316\"\n              src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IWGtKHc6Pqc?rel=0\"\n              class=\"embedVideo-iframe\"\n              style=\"border:0\"\n              \n              loading=\"eager\"\n              allowfullscreen\n\t      sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups\"\n            ></iframe>\n        </div></p>\n<h3>Project Proposal: Strike A Pose 2.0 Gamification and Playful engagement (AI/CV) |  Strike-a-Pose &#x26; Face-Fit</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://reinherit-hub.eu/tools/apps/de7756ad-67f6-4b6d-823e-0ce12f3f6c0d\">Strike-a-Pose </a>and<a href=\"https://reinherit-hub.eu/tools/apps/051e7d78-de61-4e04-8b05-ab6f7a184153\"> Face-Fit </a>web apps of the <a href=\"https://reinherit-hub.eu/tools/apps\">ReInHerit Toolkit </a> were tested and redesigned during a hackathon organised as part of the <a href=\"https://xrsalento.it/xrai-summer-school-2023/\">AI&#x26;XR Summer School </a>held in Matera in July 2023.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/f503e6b7-d25c-4428-a3bd-a18b968124ff/\" alt=\" Strike a Pose 2.0 | ReInHerit Hackathon - Summer School Matera 2023\" title=\" Strike a Pose 2.0 | ReInHerit Hackathon - Summer School Matera 2023\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/5811a641-4ac1-4e5a-9b2d-49935fab741f/\" alt=\" Strike a Pose 2.0 | ReInHerit Hackathon - Summer School Matera 2023\" title=\" Strike a Pose 2.0 | ReInHerit Hackathon - Summer School Matera 2023\"></p>\n<h3>Team:</h3>\n<p>A multidisciplinary group of young PhD students worked on the theme <em>\"Gamification and the playful approach\"</em>, testing the Strike-a-Pose and Face-Fit apps, using the open-source codes of Digital Hub.
