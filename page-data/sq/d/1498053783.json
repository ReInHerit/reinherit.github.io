This implies that the tablet should remain constantly active without enabling any screensaver, ensuring uninterrupted visibility and continuous operation of the designated app or website.</p>\n<p>To achieve this, we recommend using a kiosk mode or similar feature that allows you to lock the tablet into a single app or website. This will prevent the user from accessing other apps or features on the tablet and help to ensure a smooth and distraction-free experience.</p>\n<p>Kiosk mode, also known as \"single-app mode\" or \"lockdown mode,\" is a feature that allows a device to run a specific application exclusively, restricting access to other apps or system functions. It is commonly used in public environments, self-service stations, or exhibition displays to provide a controlled and focused user experience.</p>\n<p>In kiosk mode, the device is typically configured to launch a particular application automatically upon startup. Once in kiosk mode, the user cannot exit or switch to other apps or make changes to the system settings without appropriate authorization.</p>\n<p>Kiosk mode works by disabling or hiding various device functionalities and options that are not relevant to the designated application. This may include disabling the home button, recent apps button, notifications, status bar, and preventing access to device settings. The intention is to create a dedicated and secure environment for users to interact with a specific application without distractions or unauthorized actions.</p>\n<p>To exit kiosk mode, specific actions or authentication mechanisms (e.g., entering a PIN code or using a dedicated key combination) may be required to regain full access to the device's regular functionality.</p>\n<p>It's important to note that the specific implementation and features of kiosk mode can vary depending on the operating system and device manufacturer.</p>\n<h3>Recommended setup &#x26; security</h3>\n<p>Due to the wide variety of tablets available, frequent updates, and changes within operating systems, we cannot provide a specific and detailed list of instructions for setting up your tablet. What we can provide is a list of recommendations and security measures.</p>\n<p>While not mandatory, it is highly recommended to take these precautions in case a visitor with malicious intent gains access to the tablet:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Delete all accounts and personal/company data stored on the tablet.</li>\n<li>Remove any saved passwords from the tablet.</li>\n<li>Set a PIN Code for your tablet</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Android Setup</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Remove Navigation Bar</strong></em></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Access the Settings: Open the Settings app on your Android tablet.
