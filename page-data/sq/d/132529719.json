{"data":{"allMarkdownRemark":{"edges":[{"node":{"html":"<p>ReInHerit’s Travelling Exhibition architecture adapts to the specific conditions of each venue. It\r\nis modular, flexible in use and expandable. The spatial organisation depends on the dimension of\r\nthe exhibition space, the number of exhibited Key Objects, the light situation and the situation of\r\nthe entrance. In the present case it is a configuration for three Key Objects in a 40 m2 space. Each\r\nof the Key Objects defines a spatial footprint in the exhibition space consisting of a Projection,\r\nBench and a Box, representing the Key Object. The design of the modular Boxes is related to the\r\nphysical dimensions of digital Key Objects as core entities.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/f808405d-f69b-4fff-b841-15b3a01430a3/\" alt=\"map ReInHerit’s Travelling Exhibition architecture\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/d2b218d8-d1bb-4e30-85cc-2eb0eefc5ca8/\" alt=\"map ReInHerit’s Travelling Exhibition architecture\"></p>\n<p>EXACT DIMENSIONS</p>\n<p>Elements of the Exhibition are distributed according to a hexagonal grid with a side length of 125\r\ncm.
