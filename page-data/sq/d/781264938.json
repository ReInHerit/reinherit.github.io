Compassion feeds creativity, learning and well-being, which in turn contributes to a sustainable competitive advantage. An organization that encourages acts of compassion has a positive impact on innovation, collaboration, retention of staff and customers and willingness to change.</p>\n<p>Still, we know that acts of compassion are rare. In this webinar we will talk about the myths that prevent us from acting compassionately and share stories from our work and research that show how, in fact, it is difficult and even rebellious to act compassionately because if often requires that norms or conventions are broken.</p>\n<p>At its core, compassion is the ability to empathize with the suffering and struggles of others, coupled with a genuine desire to alleviate their pain. Ultimately, compassion is a rebellious act because it challenges the dominant paradigms and invites us to envision a more just world. It is a call to action, urging us to step outside the confines of societal expectations and prioritize the well-being of others.</p>\n<h3>Speakers:</h3>\n<p><strong>Henrika Franck</strong> <br>\n<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/henrika-franck-711aa83/\">Henrika Franck</a> is Dean of the Graduate School and Research at Arcada UAS and affiliated professor at Åbo Akademi University and Aalto University in Helsinki.

Narration and storytelling can take different forms. The development and presentation of an exhibition, the design of an educational programme for children, guided tours and books all are based on narration and storytelling techniques. These techniques unfold the interesting story of different objects of a museum, revealing their origin and new context within the museum they are placed in. This webinar aims at presenting the key uses of narration and storytelling in a museum context in relation to different museum activities, also featuring case studies and examples from the Museum of Cycladic Art in Athens, Greece. </p>\n<h3>Speakers:</h3>\n<p><strong>Nefeli Bantela</strong> has studied English and Greek Language and Literature at the University of Athens.

Have you heard of prototyping in museums?</p>\n<p>Nowadays museums are increasingly seen as places of experience and dialogue. They are multi-voiced, story-oriented, open for provocation and reflection. To stay relevant and engaging museums need to innovate and have a visitor-centred approach. Developing new services and products that appeal to your visitors is vital to retain and increase visitor volumes, whilst enabling a meaningful experience. Oftentimes, though, a lack of resources is a hindrance. Development work is regarded as expensive but, is it really? This is where co-creation comes into the picture. In an environment of change and reflection co-creation is an apt, and surprisingly affordable tool to use when developing new museum products and services. </p>\n<p>The aim of this webinar is to delve into how co-creation can be used in developing permanent and temporary exhibitions. A particular focus will be on the usefulness of prototyping as a vital part of the co-creation process. Why is it useful to prototype? What do museums gain from engaging in prototyping? What do you need to start prototyping?</p>\n<p>Concept and Experience Designer Ines Montalvao will provide answers to these questions and tell us stories about co-creation processes she has been working on in museums around the world. Webinar co-facilitator Susanne Ådahl, Researcher in the ReInHerit project based at Arcada University of Applied Sciences will engage in a dialogue with Ines to deepen these important questions of museum development work.</p>\n<h3>Speakers:</h3>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/susannetheresiaadahl/\">Susanne Ådahl</a></strong> has a PhD in Social Anthropology from the University of Helsinki and has studied Service Design at the University of Lapland.

It was fantastic witnessing the tester twisting arms up, torsos inclining left and right, fitting faces onto famous works of art – entertainment combined with enlightment and learning.</p>\n<p>It was an opportunity to learn from the interaction with users on how to improve our tools according to their needs and suggestions. Involving users is key to mediating meaningful dialogues and paving way for innovation.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“This event is an opportunity to learn from each other, to exchange ideas and insights, and to foster new collaborations that will drive forward new innovations and discoveries.”, said Dean Henrika Franck, as she opened Arcada’s Research Fair.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The response was enthusiastic and users pondered how these apps could be applied to other sectors that Arcada provides education to like nursing sciences and physiotherapy.

In a period in which museums are increasingly adopting digital tools for mediating and communicating with their audiences, aiming to foster participation and reach a broader set of publics, it is becoming increasingly important to also develop clearer evaluation methods for analysing the impact of these digital initiatives. Although digital audience research has a longer history, during the last decade – and in particular in the recent COVID-19 years – the need for clear workflows, benchmarks, and data practices to gather and analyse the experiences of online visitors and users of our digital applications has become a priority for the sector.</p>\n<p>This webinar will briefly introduce the context in which these studies have been developed and, subsequently, focus on qualitative and quantitative methods for researching digital audiences and analysing digital engagement.</p>\n<h3>Speaker:</h3>\n<p>Dr Chiara Zuanni is an assistant professor in Digital Museology in the Centre for Information Modelling at the University of Graz (Austria).

Photogrammetry is a technology that uses photos of objects to convert them into a digital 3D model with the help of specialized software tools. In recent years, the technology has become increasingly easy to access and use even for people who do not have a background in imaging technology. It holds potential for museums and Cultural Heritage institutions who are interested in exploring new ways of digitizing, preserving, exploring and exhibiting Cultural Heritage objects while working with a limited budget. The webinar discusses the basic photogrammetry process by showing hands-on example cases. It will focus on the technical requirements and challenges in creating 3D models with photogrammetry, with a special focus on potential issues in working with Cultural heritage objects. After the webinar, participants will have a basic understanding of the photogrammetry process, will be familiar with potential challenges and issues in digitizing objects with photogrammetry and will have the foundational knowledge to test out photogrammetry themselves.</p>\n<h3>Speaker:</h3>\n<p>Helene Goedl, BA is a multimedia technology professional currently working in the department for Digital Museology at Graz Museum in Graz, Austria.

In particular, the ‘Smart Tourism’ framework of the European Commission - Directorate-General for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs (DG GROW) will be presented as well as the ‘Smart Destinations’ initiative of the United Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO). Smart tourism as defined by the EC responds to new challenges and demands in a fast-changing sector, including the evolution of digital tools, products, and services; equal opportunity and access for all visitors; sustainable development of the local area; and support to creative industries, local talent and heritage.  Smart Tourism is thus closely related to cultural heritage with digitalisation in sustainable cultural tourism development and promotion. The new ‘European Capital of Smart Tourism Award’ since 2019 has components of ‘Sustainability, Accessibility, Digitalisation, Cultural Heritage and Creativity’. Cultural Heritage aspects are about protecting and capitalising on the cultural heritage, as well as local potential and its creative assets. A smart destination according to UNWTO is one with a strategy for technology, innovation, sustainability, accessibility, and inclusivity, along the entire tourism cycle: before, during and after the trip. The pillars that comprise a smart destination thus include sustainability, innovation, and technology, which are closely related to the scope of the ‘ReInHerit’ Horizon2020 Coordination and Support Action (CSA).</p>\n<h3>Speakers:</h3>\n<p><strong>Manos Vougioukas</strong><br>\nis Secretary-General of the European Cultural Tourism Network (ECTN), the only pan-European Network that brings together the cultural, heritage and tourism sectors to work together for sustainable cultural tourism development and promotion. He has established, managed, and coordinated 12 EU co-funded projects on sustainable and cultural tourism during the past 25 years. He is the main author of the ‘Charter for Sustainable Cultural Tourism’ adopted by ECTN. He holds BSc and MSc degrees and a Diploma in Economics. He served as a member of the Stakeholders Committee for European Year of Cultural Heritage in 2018, selected by EC DG EAC. He has been active in all UNWTO Smart Destinations conferences and supported the EU Smart Tourism Capital initiative from its outset. More recently, he has coordinated the Interreg Europe DESTI-SMART project. He is a member of Europa Nostra, Interpret Europe, the Tourism Society and Europeana Network.</p>\n<p><strong>Nasos Hadjigeorgiou</strong> <br>\nis the President of the European Cultural Tourism Network (ECTN) since January 2021, having previously served as ECTN Vice-President for 4 years (2017-2020). He serves as Executive Manager of the Pafos Regional Board of Tourism since its establishment. The Pafos Regional Board of Tourism is the official body representing all the sectors involved in the region’s tourism industry. The Board consists of thirteen members, including the four Municipalities, Deputy Ministry of Tourism, the Union of Pafos Communities, hoteliers’ association, chamber of commerce and representatives of all associations related to the travel industry. Nasos Hadjigeorgiou has a long presence in the tourism industry having served through various levels including supervising, head of department and almost all aspects of hospitality. He has been involved in several Interreg projects on sustainable cultural tourism, digitalisation, cultural routes, smart tourism mobility and accessibility.

The immersive performance in focus hopes to provide a template for collaborations for developing similar projects that are shaped by cultural heritage sites and in turn help to attract wider audiences to them. It was planned, developed and realised in parallel to the setup of the ReInHerit Digital Hub. A diverse group of professionals, namely artists, archaeologists and computer scientists, joined forces to create this project, resulting in an interdisciplinary performance, consisting of a combination of live music, sound art, video art, lighting design, programming, 3D printing and temporary exhibition curation, that invited its audience to take initiative in shaping their experience of it.  The performance was hosted at the Ethnological Museum of Cyprus on 29 October 2022. The venue is mostly known as the mansion of the Dragoman Hadjigeorgakis Kornesios, a high-ranking official in Ottoman Cyprus and the palace of the House of Podocataro, dating back to the 15th century. The venue was chosen because of its significance as a unique monument of cultural heritage that combines several layers of Nicosia’s rich history within its walls. It is also a space that attracts only a small number of daily visitors, coming mostly from school field trips and privately guided tours.   For this project, the team of ITICA from CYENS CoE created an immersive performance within a cultural heritage site, consisting of a temporary large-scale sound installation, combining fixed media and live electronics (pre-recorded and interactive music) with a group of nine musicians. The audience and performers navigated the performance space and triggered sonic events where they entered to explore, depending on locations of sound installation receivers. Thus, each audience member received an individualised experience of the cultural heritage space, shaped by their personal choices on where to go, what to focus on, who or what to interact with and for how long, within the space, during the performance.  The project’s objective was to create a performance that would offer visitors an alternative mode of experiencing exhibits and spaces within this cultural heritage site, inviting them to interact and engage with the spaces or exhibits in a holistic way i.e. a specially designed multi-media experience, which is site-specific, exhibit-specific, time-limited, unique and deeply personal for each visitor that comes to the space during the performance. It is a case study in developing a performance that is informed by a cultural heritage site, that grows within, respects, and helps enhance pre-existing exhibitions and museum spaces.</p>\n<p>Image caption (first 4 photos): Musicians and audience interacting with the sound installation in various spots of the mansion.

It is suitable for all ages and will be presented in three different starting times, for a limited audience.</p>\n<p>The performance offers an innovative approach to the curation of the visitors’ experience within cultural heritage sites, for which we are creating an immersive experience within a museum. The performance consists of a temporary large-scale sound installation, which combines prerecorded sound and live electronics with a small group of musicians from the Cyprus Symphony Orchestra, video projection, theatrical lighting and multisensory haptic exhibits.</p>\n<p>During the performance, the audience and performers navigate the spaces of the museum freely and trigger sonic events wherever and whenever they enter to explore, depending on the placement of the sound installation’s digital sensors. Thus, every visitor receives an individualised experience of the cultural heritage space, shaped by their personal choices on where to move to, what to focus on and for how long during the performance.</p>\n<p>ReInHerit was acquired through Horizon 2020 CSA under the pillar Culture beyond borders – Facilitating innovation and research cooperation between European museums and heritage.

Equally, all Consortium partners will now begin to upload regular outputs and news to the Hub.</p>\n<p>In particular, the Hub includes three main types of content and areas:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Resources</strong>, produced within the ReInHerit project and targeted at heritage professionals. These include a toolkit (with Computer Vision applications and training material on their components and development process), a series of webinars (whose recordings and any added material will be made available on the Hub), documentation explaining the processes and methods used to develop the ReInHerit videogame and two immersive performances, documentation on the planning and collaboration methods used to develop a collaborative series of travelling and digital exhibitions and the ReInHerit eShop, reports and presentations on the Best Practices in cultural heritage management (as emerging from primary research conducted in the project). All this material will be uploaded between Autumn 2022 and Spring 2023, so check the Hub for any update in the coming months!</li>\n<li><strong>Networking area</strong>, with a Forum open to anyone interested in connecting and exchanging experiences on digital transformation, sustainability, and management in cultural heritage and tourism. Occasionally, in this area, there will be more opportunity to network, around the shared online collection, the events, and the outputs of the project.</li>\n<li><strong>Engaging content</strong>, produced within the project with innovative collaborations and processes. Here, you will find the ReInHerit exhibitions and shared online collection, an eShop (with free digital products), downloadable apps and the videogame, and the promotion of the various events.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Follow the news on the Digital Hub, check out our products and research outputs, and join the conversation in the Forum!</p>","excerpt":"Welcome to the ReInHerit Digital Hub!
