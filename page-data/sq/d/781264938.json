The goal of “Strike a Pose” and “Face Fit” applications is to challenge the users to analyze and replicate artworks with their own body and face, obtaining information about the replicated artworks and personalized representations that can be shared on social networks.  A gamification approach is useful both for improving the skills and competencies of museum professionals and for engaging visitors in museum content through the design of playful and participative digital learning scenarios in a \"play and interact\" visiting style. In the presentation will be analyzed the technical requirements needed to develop this type of applications and the computer vision techniques needed to implement this type of interaction.</p>\n<h3>Speaker:</h3>\n<p><strong>Marco Bertini</strong><br>\n<a href=\"https://www.micc.unifi.it/people/marco-bertini/\">Marco Bertini</a> is Associate Professor in Computer Science at the University of Florence, Italy.

It is suitable for all ages and will be presented in three different starting times, for a limited audience.</p>\n<p>The performance offers an innovative approach to the curation of the visitors’ experience within cultural heritage sites, for which we are creating an immersive experience within a museum. The performance consists of a temporary large-scale sound installation, which combines prerecorded sound and live electronics with a small group of musicians from the Cyprus Symphony Orchestra, video projection, theatrical lighting and multisensory haptic exhibits.</p>\n<p>During the performance, the audience and performers navigate the spaces of the museum freely and trigger sonic events wherever and whenever they enter to explore, depending on the placement of the sound installation’s digital sensors. Thus, every visitor receives an individualised experience of the cultural heritage space, shaped by their personal choices on where to move to, what to focus on and for how long during the performance.</p>\n<p>ReInHerit was acquired through Horizon 2020 CSA under the pillar Culture beyond borders – Facilitating innovation and research cooperation between European museums and heritage.

Equally, all Consortium partners will now begin to upload regular outputs and news to the Hub.</p>\n<p>In particular, the Hub includes three main types of content and areas:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Resources</strong>, produced within the ReInHerit project and targeted at heritage professionals. These include a toolkit (with Computer Vision applications and training material on their components and development process), a series of webinars (whose recordings and any added material will be made available on the Hub), documentation explaining the processes and methods used to develop the ReInHerit videogame and two immersive performances, documentation on the planning and collaboration methods used to develop a collaborative series of travelling and digital exhibitions and the ReInHerit eShop, reports and presentations on the Best Practices in cultural heritage management (as emerging from primary research conducted in the project). All this material will be uploaded between Autumn 2022 and Spring 2023, so check the Hub for any update in the coming months!</li>\n<li><strong>Networking area</strong>, with a Forum open to anyone interested in connecting and exchanging experiences on digital transformation, sustainability, and management in cultural heritage and tourism. Occasionally, in this area, there will be more opportunity to network, around the shared online collection, the events, and the outputs of the project.</li>\n<li><strong>Engaging content</strong>, produced within the project with innovative collaborations and processes. Here, you will find the ReInHerit exhibitions and shared online collection, an eShop (with free digital products), downloadable apps and the videogame, and the promotion of the various events.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Follow the news on the Digital Hub, check out our products and research outputs, and join the conversation in the Forum!</p>","excerpt":"Welcome to the ReInHerit Digital Hub!
