The seminar will focus on issues pertaining to IP Management and in particular on how museums can be assisted to set up processes to identify, organize, own, create value, license, disseminate and generally deal with and leverage ‘business’ opportunities in relation to content. That means a) effectively protecting their IP assets, b) preventing the infringement of third-party IP rights, and c) disseminating content as they see appropriate.</p>\n<h3>Speaker:</h3>\n<p><strong>Irini Stamatoudi</strong> <br>\nIrini Stamatoudi is an attorney-at-law and a law professor at the University of Nicosia (Cyprus) specialized in IP and in Cultural Heritage Law.

The goal of “Strike a Pose” and “Face Fit” applications is to challenge the users to analyze and replicate artworks with their own body and face, obtaining information about the replicated artworks and personalized representations that can be shared on social networks.  A gamification approach is useful both for improving the skills and competencies of museum professionals and for engaging visitors in museum content through the design of playful and participative digital learning scenarios in a \"play and interact\" visiting style. In the presentation will be analyzed the technical requirements needed to develop this type of applications and the computer vision techniques needed to implement this type of interaction.</p>\n<h3>Speaker:</h3>\n<p><strong>Marco Bertini</strong><br>\n<a href=\"https://www.micc.unifi.it/people/marco-bertini/\">Marco Bertini</a> is Associate Professor in Computer Science at the University of Florence, Italy.
