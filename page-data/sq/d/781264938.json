This blog post gives a brief overview of the how the 3D reconstruction was done.</p>\n<p>The team of ReInHerit created the 3D artifacts of the project using a process called photogrammetry. Photogrammetry is a technique used to measure and record physical spaces or objects, translating them into digital 3D models.  The process involves capturing multiple overlapping photos of an object from different angles. These photos are then analyzed and matched using software like Reality Capture, Metashape or Meshroom, which is a free and open-source 3D Reconstruction Software.  These software identify points between the photos and build a highly accurate 3D representation of the artifact.  This method was chosen because it does not require specialized equipment and can be done in-place inside the museum, allowing for the digitization of valuable artifacts without the need for transportation. To get high quality images, the artifacts were placed on a rotating platform in front of a black matte surface. The experts of BoCCF were moving around the object using gloves and making sure everything was handled respectfully.</p>\n<p>The team also used Blender, a free and open-source 3D creation suite, to optimize the models by reducing the vertex/face count using a Decimate modifier.  This process helps to optimize performance by reducing the complexity of the 3D models based on their distance from the player's viewpoint. Additionally, metadata associated with the artifacts, such as category, period, style, material, dimensions, and description, was fetched from the BOCCF online collection to provide descriptive information about each artifact in the game. Links to more detailed information about each artifact were added in the game.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/a4d4e543-d73f-4e26-973e-f9df6661e6c8/\" alt=\"\"></p>","excerpt":"The teams of CYENS and the Bank of Cyprus Cultural Foundation worked closely to a) create 3D models of artifacts from the collection of the…","frontmatter":{"title":"Digitizing artifacts of the Bank of Cyprus Cultural Foundation for the game","pageId":"abcdae2b-cc53-4501-a778-fbc73dba6685","date":"10 months ago","target_audience":["VISITOR","PROFESSIONAL"],"theme":"Technology","layout":"blog","mainReference":null,"thumbnail":"https://ucarecdn.com/aaaacc8f-8efc-4610-ba2a-e6a500c77f86/-/crop/675x556/0,0/-/preview/"},"wordCount":{"words":309}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/bb48293b-52d8-4b49-85ae-95808469ffb4/\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The <strong>user interface (UI)</strong> of a game plays a crucial role in providing an immersive and enjoyable experience for players.  In the case of the ReInHerit game, the UI has been carefully designed to facilitate easy navigation, effective communication of game information, and intuitive interaction with the game elements. This blog post will explore the various aspects of the user interface in the ReInHerit game and how they contribute to enhancing the overall user experience.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Start UI:</strong> The start screen of the game sets the tone for the player's journey. In the ReInHerit game, the start UI is clean and visually appealing, with four buttons - Play, Quit, Continue, and Options. The buttons are clearly labeled and positioned for easy access. The \"Play\" button starts the game from the beginning, while the \"Quit\" button closes the game.  The \"Continue\" button allows players to resume the game from a previously saved state, and the \"Options\" button provides options to adjust game volume and graphics quality.</li>\n<li><strong>Game UI:</strong> The game UI in the ReInHerit game is designed to provide players with all the necessary information and controls to navigate and interact with the game world.  The main components of the game UI include:\r\n(1) This component displays important information such as the current round, available in-game money, score, and total number of visitors.  It helps players track their progress and make informed decisions.  (2) This button allows players to save the current state of the game.  It provides a sense of control and allows players to continue their progress from where they left off.\r\n(3) This button enters the player into building mode, where they can add new rooms, delete existing rooms, and connect rooms with doors.  The dropdown list provides a range of options for room manipulation, and players can execute their chosen action by clicking and dragging on the blue grid.\r\n(4) This button enters the player into curating mode, where they can select artifacts from their inventory and place them in the museum.  It allows players to showcase their collection and create an engaging museum experience.\r\n(5) This button changes the museum's state to open, allowing visitors to enter and explore the museum.  It signifies a milestone in the game progression and adds a sense of achievement.\r\n(6) This slider enables players to speed up the game, allowing them to progress at their desired pace.  It provides flexibility and customization options for players.</li>\n<li><strong>Artifact Control:</strong> In the ReInHerit game, players can interact with placed artifacts in the museum.  When an artifact is clicked, a set of options is presented to the player.  These options include entering observation mode, upgrading the artifact's case, modifying its position, and cleaning the artifact.  These interactions add depth to the gameplay and allow players to engage with the artifacts on a more personal level.</li>\n<li><strong>High-Quality Art and Animation:</strong>  The user interface of the ReInHerit game is visually appealing, with high-quality art and animations.  The use of generative AI tools like Midjourney and Stable Diffusion has allowed for the creation of unique and visually stunning images and icons.  The character animations, created using Mixamo and Unity's Third Person Controller, provide lifelike movements and enhance the overall immersion of the game.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The user interface of the ReInHerit game has been thoughtfully designed to enhance the user experience.  From the start screen to the in-game UI elements, every aspect has been carefully considered to provide players with a seamless and enjoyable gaming experience.  The clean and intuitive design, coupled with high-quality art and animations, contributes to the overall immersion and engagement of players.</p>","excerpt":"The user interface (UI) of a game plays a crucial role in providing an immersive and enjoyable experience for players.

The player serves as the protégé of the Bank of Cyprus Cultural Foundation Director and is tasked with running the museum for a month to prove their worthiness.  The game progresses through rounds, with players managing the museum in closed and open modes.  In the open mode, visitors come to the museum to view exhibits, and events occur that can have positive or negative effects on the museum.  The game continues until the player either wins by meeting certain conditions or loses by bankruptcy or low ratings.</p>\n<p>The game has specific <strong>rules</strong> that control the players' actions and define the objectives and consequences of their actions.  The winning condition is met when players reach a certain number of rounds without failing conditions such as bankruptcy or low ratings.  The museum can be opened or closed based on certain conditions, and the game includes task difficulty that increases as players progress, requiring more budget, maintenance, and artifact placement.</p>\n<p>The game also includes various roles such as the museum director (controlled by the player), architect (for building custom museums), curator (responsible for placing artifacts), keepers (workers who move artifacts), visitors (controlled by AI and assess the player's performance), conservators (restore artifacts), and janitors (keep the museum clean).

The annual gathering, spearheaded by <a href=\"https://www.materahub.com\">Materahub</a>, transcends the conventional boundaries of conferences and festivals, fostering a rich soil for meaningful dialogue, spirited debate, and the cultivation of transformative collaborations. Serving as a guiding light for those navigating the complexities of our era, Magma Fest envisions a space where diverse perspectives converge to tackle pressing global challenges. Magma Fest deviates from the traditional event format, functioning as a safe haven for discourse and cooperation. Much like the ever-shifting magma beneath our feet, individuals discover equilibrium through collective efforts, particularly amid the unprecedented challenges of our times. Magma Fest aspires to nurture an environment conducive to the creation of innovative, non-disciplinary models. This inclusive ethos encourages contributions from diverse visions, competencies, and approaches, paving the way for the emergence of unexpected solutions to complex challenges.</p>\n<p><strong>Exploration of Tourism and Technology:</strong> </p>\n<p>The second edition of Magma Fest unfolded an immersive exploration into the intricate realms of tourism and technology, dismantling these vast themes into manageable fragments of inquiry. Questions such as \"Can a hotel transcend its traditional role and become a cultural epicenter?\" and \"Can a tourist transform into a catalyst for local change?\" ignited engaging discussions, prompting participants to envision novel possibilities. Keynote speakers Nicola Zanola and Luca Baraldi shared valuable insights, anchoring the working days around Materahub's strategic projects—Cultour Data and Reinherit.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/2343da8f-0253-4265-a07e-bef16874ec29/\" alt=\"Cultural Convergence, Reinherit Lights up Magma Fest\" title=\"Cultural Convergence, Reinherit Lights up Magma Fest\"></p>\n<p>The first day of the festival was dedicated to the theme of tourism, featuring insightful presentations from Cristina Amenta and Vania Cauzillo of <a href=\"https://www.ecoverticale.it\">EcoVerticale</a>, a captivating cultural space and hotel in Matera.

As a Horizon2020 project, ReInHerit proposes a revolutionary model focused on developing a digital cultural heritage ecosystem. This visionary approach invites key stakeholders—museums, heritage sites, policy makers, professionals, and communities—into an open and collaborative space to experiment, share, and innovate.  Paolo Mazzanti presented the methodology and insights derived from ReInHerit, illustrating how this initiative is poised to revolutionize the cultural heritage landscape. With a focus on the <a href=\"https://reinherit-hub.eu/applications\">ReinHerit Toolkit</a>, playful engagement and people-centered approach in Museums using AI/CV. The project's ultimate goal is to establish a dynamic platform that facilitates interaction and collaboration among diverse stakeholders, leveraging technology to preserve and enhance the rich experience of Matera's iconic Sassi.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Info: <a href=\"https://www.magmafest.it\">https://www.magmafest.it</a></li>\n<li>Blogpost: <a href=\"https://www.materahub.com/magma-fest-2023-report/\">https://www.materahub.com/magma-fest-2023-report</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n        <div class=\"embedVideo-container\">\n            <iframe\n              title=\"\"\n              width=\"560\"\n              height=\"316\"\n              src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6NqbUVsWeBg?rel=0\"\n              class=\"embedVideo-iframe\"\n              style=\"border:0\"\n              \n              loading=\"eager\"\n              allowfullscreen\n\t      sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups\"\n            ></iframe>\n        </div></p>\n<p>\n        <div class=\"embedVideo-container\">\n            <iframe\n              title=\"\"\n              width=\"560\"\n              height=\"316\"\n              src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RNoItgED5BI?rel=0\"\n              class=\"embedVideo-iframe\"\n              style=\"border:0\"\n              \n              loading=\"eager\"\n              allowfullscreen\n\t      sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups\"\n            ></iframe>\n        </div></p>\n<p>\n        <div class=\"embedVideo-container\">\n            <iframe\n              title=\"\"\n              width=\"560\"\n              height=\"316\"\n              src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TN6ONcMHXqo?rel=0\"\n              class=\"embedVideo-iframe\"\n              style=\"border:0\"\n              \n              loading=\"eager\"\n              allowfullscreen\n\t      sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups\"\n            ></iframe>\n        </div></p>\n<p>\n        <div class=\"embedVideo-container\">\n            <iframe\n              title=\"\"\n              width=\"560\"\n              height=\"316\"\n              src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/w8stRHgXKYA?rel=0\"\n              class=\"embedVideo-iframe\"\n              style=\"border:0\"\n              \n              loading=\"eager\"\n              allowfullscreen\n\t      sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups\"\n            ></iframe>\n        </div></p>","excerpt":"Cultural Convergence, Reinherit Lights up Magma Fest In a dynamic celebration of interdisciplinary synergy and groundbreaking innovation…","frontmatter":{"title":"Cultural Convergence, ReInHerit Lights up Magma Fest","pageId":"07fa5b02-9213-449d-adf3-6e0725736e69","date":"a year ago","target_audience":["VISITOR","PROFESSIONAL"],"theme":"Technology","layout":"blog","mainReference":null,"thumbnail":"https://ucarecdn.com/fd50fe57-441d-422e-97b6-993e2de3462a/-/preview/"},"wordCount":{"words":514}}},{"node":{"html":"<p>Prof. Conxa Rodà, former head of strategy and digital innovation at the @museunacional of Art in Catalonia, and professor at the @uocuniversitat of Catalonia, will give us valuable guidelines on how to ensure the longevity of digital initiatives in museums, address key challenges in digital sustainability, and mitigate the environmental impact of digital strategies through green measures in the cultural sector.</p>\n<p>Listen now at: <a href=\"https://rss.com/podcasts/museumsup-reinherit/\">https://rss.com/podcasts/museumsup-reinherit/</a> and also on podcast platforms Spotify, Apple, Google, Amazon and Samsung.</p>","excerpt":"Prof. Conxa Rodà, former head of strategy and digital innovation at the @museunacional of Art in Catalonia, and professor at the…","frontmatter":{"title":"Museums Up -

These changes have huge implications for the global economy, industry and wider society as a whole.</p>\n<p>They could not leave the world of culture untouched. Their contribution to the protection of archaeological sites and monuments in an environment of intense climatic phenomena is very important and is rapidly evolving through the application of technological achievements. By presenting the scope of these technologies and focusing on their application in the protection of archaeological sites and monuments, the need for interconnection and integration of new technologies with archaeological sites and monuments is highlighted.</p>\n<p>Following the role of these emerging technologies, a novel practical approach will be presented that consists of risk assessment techniques and edge technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things. The practical, holistic and easily adaptable methodology will reveal how intelligent agent technology can have a significant impact, improving the way in which first responders and monument managers, even visitors, react to and handle risky or emergency situations. A pilot case study will emphasize how monuments and human lives can be protected and saved. The aim is to understand how right prognosis along with smart decisions will help prevent potential damage to the Cultural and Natural heritage without human losses. </p>\n<h3>Speakers:</h3>\n<p><strong>Apostolos Tsagaris</strong><br>\nis Associate Professor in the field of Human interaction with mechatronic and robotic systems in the Department of Industrial Engineering and management at International Hellenic University of Thessaloniki, Greece and at this time he is the Head of the department.

The prevalence of mental and physical chronic diseases is increasing globally. In addition, the changing demographics towards an aging population pose a challenge to health care systems since aging is associated with a decrease in physical and mental capacity and an increased risk of developing disease. Museums may be integrated into the lifestyle of patients suffering from chronic conditions due to their value in offering non-pharmacological therapeutic methods to improve the patient's experience with disease. The interactive environment of museums may have positive health outcomes not only for patients with chronic diseases but also for improving the physical and mental wellbeing of elderly and younger populations. This webinar explores recent literature investigating the effects of art-based museum interventions on (a) patients with chronic diagnoses associated with mental health and/or physical impairment such as dementia, drug addiction and cancer, (b) hospitalised patients and (b) the wellbeing of young and elderly populations.  During the webinar recent studies will be discussed which provide evidence that museum art-based interventions may be integrated as part of the non-pharmacological management of patients suffering from chronic disorders and hospitalised patients as well as for improving the wellbeing of younger and elderly populations.</p>\n<h3>Speakers:</h3>\n<p><strong>Dr Ioanna Hadjicosti -</strong> Director of the Bank of Cyprus Cultural Foundation and Coordinator of ReInherit H2020.She graduated from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece, with the BA in Greek Philology and the specialization of Classics.

What were the somatic responses to motherhood and to the irretrievable loss of their maidenhood?\r\n<br/>This online talk is delivered in English and presents classical Greek, female somatoform disorders, as these are described in the Hippocratic texts, vis-a-vis hysteria in fin de siècle Vienna and Paris. It examines the sociocultural contexts that gave rise to these female maladies, as well as to their medical (mis)diagnoses and proposed treatments. It demonstrates the doctors’ limited understanding of the various, dissimilar desiderata of their patients, and by extension of the numerous, unalike causes of these disorders.

Compassion feeds creativity, learning and well-being, which in turn contributes to a sustainable competitive advantage. An organization that encourages acts of compassion has a positive impact on innovation, collaboration, retention of staff and customers and willingness to change.</p>\n<p>Still, we know that acts of compassion are rare. In this webinar we will talk about the myths that prevent us from acting compassionately and share stories from our work and research that show how, in fact, it is difficult and even rebellious to act compassionately because if often requires that norms or conventions are broken.</p>\n<p>At its core, compassion is the ability to empathize with the suffering and struggles of others, coupled with a genuine desire to alleviate their pain. Ultimately, compassion is a rebellious act because it challenges the dominant paradigms and invites us to envision a more just world. It is a call to action, urging us to step outside the confines of societal expectations and prioritize the well-being of others.</p>\n<h3>Speakers:</h3>\n<p><strong>Henrika Franck</strong> <br>\n<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/henrika-franck-711aa83/\">Henrika Franck</a> is Dean of the Graduate School and Research at Arcada UAS and affiliated professor at Åbo Akademi University and Aalto University in Helsinki.

Narration and storytelling can take different forms. The development and presentation of an exhibition, the design of an educational programme for children, guided tours and books all are based on narration and storytelling techniques. These techniques unfold the interesting story of different objects of a museum, revealing their origin and new context within the museum they are placed in. This webinar aims at presenting the key uses of narration and storytelling in a museum context in relation to different museum activities, also featuring case studies and examples from the Museum of Cycladic Art in Athens, Greece. </p>\n<h3>Speakers:</h3>\n<p><strong>Nefeli Bantela</strong> has studied English and Greek Language and Literature at the University of Athens.

Have you heard of prototyping in museums?</p>\n<p>Nowadays museums are increasingly seen as places of experience and dialogue. They are multi-voiced, story-oriented, open for provocation and reflection. To stay relevant and engaging museums need to innovate and have a visitor-centred approach. Developing new services and products that appeal to your visitors is vital to retain and increase visitor volumes, whilst enabling a meaningful experience. Oftentimes, though, a lack of resources is a hindrance. Development work is regarded as expensive but, is it really? This is where co-creation comes into the picture. In an environment of change and reflection co-creation is an apt, and surprisingly affordable tool to use when developing new museum products and services. </p>\n<p>The aim of this webinar is to delve into how co-creation can be used in developing permanent and temporary exhibitions. A particular focus will be on the usefulness of prototyping as a vital part of the co-creation process. Why is it useful to prototype? What do museums gain from engaging in prototyping? What do you need to start prototyping?</p>\n<p>Concept and Experience Designer Ines Montalvao will provide answers to these questions and tell us stories about co-creation processes she has been working on in museums around the world. Webinar co-facilitator Susanne Ådahl, Researcher in the ReInHerit project based at Arcada University of Applied Sciences will engage in a dialogue with Ines to deepen these important questions of museum development work.</p>\n<h3>Speakers:</h3>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/susannetheresiaadahl/\">Susanne Ådahl</a></strong> has a PhD in Social Anthropology from the University of Helsinki and has studied Service Design at the University of Lapland.

Involving users is key to mediating meaningful dialogues and paving way for innovation.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“This event is an opportunity to learn from each other, to exchange ideas and insights, and to foster new collaborations that will drive forward new innovations and discoveries.”, said Dean Henrika Franck, as she opened Arcada’s Research Fair.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The response was enthusiastic and users pondered how these apps could be applied to other sectors that Arcada provides education to like nursing sciences and physiotherapy.

In a period in which museums are increasingly adopting digital tools for mediating and communicating with their audiences, aiming to foster participation and reach a broader set of publics, it is becoming increasingly important to also develop clearer evaluation methods for analysing the impact of these digital initiatives. Although digital audience research has a longer history, during the last decade – and in particular in the recent COVID-19 years – the need for clear workflows, benchmarks, and data practices to gather and analyse the experiences of online visitors and users of our digital applications has become a priority for the sector.</p>\n<p>This webinar will briefly introduce the context in which these studies have been developed and, subsequently, focus on qualitative and quantitative methods for researching digital audiences and analysing digital engagement.</p>\n<h3>Speaker:</h3>\n<p>Dr Chiara Zuanni is an assistant professor in Digital Museology in the Centre for Information Modelling at the University of Graz (Austria).

Photogrammetry is a technology that uses photos of objects to convert them into a digital 3D model with the help of specialized software tools. In recent years, the technology has become increasingly easy to access and use even for people who do not have a background in imaging technology. It holds potential for museums and Cultural Heritage institutions who are interested in exploring new ways of digitizing, preserving, exploring and exhibiting Cultural Heritage objects while working with a limited budget. The webinar discusses the basic photogrammetry process by showing hands-on example cases. It will focus on the technical requirements and challenges in creating 3D models with photogrammetry, with a special focus on potential issues in working with Cultural heritage objects. After the webinar, participants will have a basic understanding of the photogrammetry process, will be familiar with potential challenges and issues in digitizing objects with photogrammetry and will have the foundational knowledge to test out photogrammetry themselves.</p>\n<h3>Speaker:</h3>\n<p>Helene Goedl, BA is a multimedia technology professional currently working in the department for Digital Museology at Graz Museum in Graz, Austria.

In particular, the ‘Smart Tourism’ framework of the European Commission - Directorate-General for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs (DG GROW) will be presented as well as the ‘Smart Destinations’ initiative of the United Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO). Smart tourism as defined by the EC responds to new challenges and demands in a fast-changing sector, including the evolution of digital tools, products, and services; equal opportunity and access for all visitors; sustainable development of the local area; and support to creative industries, local talent and heritage.  Smart Tourism is thus closely related to cultural heritage with digitalisation in sustainable cultural tourism development and promotion. The new ‘European Capital of Smart Tourism Award’ since 2019 has components of ‘Sustainability, Accessibility, Digitalisation, Cultural Heritage and Creativity’. Cultural Heritage aspects are about protecting and capitalising on the cultural heritage, as well as local potential and its creative assets. A smart destination according to UNWTO is one with a strategy for technology, innovation, sustainability, accessibility, and inclusivity, along the entire tourism cycle: before, during and after the trip. The pillars that comprise a smart destination thus include sustainability, innovation, and technology, which are closely related to the scope of the ‘ReInHerit’ Horizon2020 Coordination and Support Action (CSA).</p>\n<h3>Speakers:</h3>\n<p><strong>Manos Vougioukas</strong><br>\nis Secretary-General of the European Cultural Tourism Network (ECTN), the only pan-European Network that brings together the cultural, heritage and tourism sectors to work together for sustainable cultural tourism development and promotion.

The goal of “Strike a Pose” and “Face Fit” applications is to challenge the users to analyze and replicate artworks with their own body and face, obtaining information about the replicated artworks and personalized representations that can be shared on social networks.  A gamification approach is useful both for improving the skills and competencies of museum professionals and for engaging visitors in museum content through the design of playful and participative digital learning scenarios in a \"play and interact\" visiting style. In the presentation will be analyzed the technical requirements needed to develop this type of applications and the computer vision techniques needed to implement this type of interaction.</p>\n<h3>Speaker:</h3>\n<p><strong>Marco Bertini</strong><br>\n<a href=\"https://www.micc.unifi.it/people/marco-bertini/\">Marco Bertini</a> is Associate Professor in Computer Science at the University of Florence, Italy.

The immersive performance in focus hopes to provide a template for collaborations for developing similar projects that are shaped by cultural heritage sites and in turn help to attract wider audiences to them. It was planned, developed and realised in parallel to the setup of the ReInHerit Digital Hub. A diverse group of professionals, namely artists, archaeologists and computer scientists, joined forces to create this project, resulting in an interdisciplinary performance, consisting of a combination of live music, sound art, video art, lighting design, programming, 3D printing and temporary exhibition curation, that invited its audience to take initiative in shaping their experience of it.  The performance was hosted at the Ethnological Museum of Cyprus on 29 October 2022. The venue is mostly known as the mansion of the Dragoman Hadjigeorgakis Kornesios, a high-ranking official in Ottoman Cyprus and the palace of the House of Podocataro, dating back to the 15th century. The venue was chosen because of its significance as a unique monument of cultural heritage that combines several layers of Nicosia’s rich history within its walls. It is also a space that attracts only a small number of daily visitors, coming mostly from school field trips and privately guided tours.   For this project, the team of ITICA from CYENS CoE created an immersive performance within a cultural heritage site, consisting of a temporary large-scale sound installation, combining fixed media and live electronics (pre-recorded and interactive music) with a group of nine musicians. The audience and performers navigated the performance space and triggered sonic events where they entered to explore, depending on locations of sound installation receivers. Thus, each audience member received an individualised experience of the cultural heritage space, shaped by their personal choices on where to go, what to focus on, who or what to interact with and for how long, within the space, during the performance.  The project’s objective was to create a performance that would offer visitors an alternative mode of experiencing exhibits and spaces within this cultural heritage site, inviting them to interact and engage with the spaces or exhibits in a holistic way i.e. a specially designed multi-media experience, which is site-specific, exhibit-specific, time-limited, unique and deeply personal for each visitor that comes to the space during the performance. It is a case study in developing a performance that is informed by a cultural heritage site, that grows within, respects, and helps enhance pre-existing exhibitions and museum spaces.</p>\n<p>Image caption (first 4 photos): Musicians and audience interacting with the sound installation in various spots of the mansion.
