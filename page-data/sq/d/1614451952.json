Aligned with CSA, the aim of the project was to create a model of sustainable heritage management for fostering a digital dynamic European network of heritage stakeholders through the Digital Hub. The ReInHerit Digital Hub provides to relevant stakeholders (museums, heritage sites, policy makers, professionals and communities) with the tools and resources to communicate, experiment, innovate and disseminate European cultural heritage.</p>\n<p>To achieve this, the project was implemented by adopting a bottom-up approach, meaning that involved the consortium partners and external museum and heritage professionals from the beginning. The collaboration in the project was divided into three phases. The aim of the first phase was to identify the sector’s needs, challenges and practices across Europe by using quantitative and qualitative research methods (desk research, focus group interviews and questionnaires). During this phase the consortium partners held multiple ideation workshops for formulating the focus group interview questions and the questionnaires to gain information from professionals and visitors with the aim on how to develop the Digital Hub and its resources. A comprehensive map of the stakeholder’s practices and perceptions on European cultural heritage was created with the produced (qualitative and quantitative data) and allowed the partners responsible for developing the exhibitions and the digital apps to (cross)examine the needs, challenges and practices of the sector across different levels.  In doing so, the consortium collected important information on the digital transformation of heritage sites and museums, its impact, innovation potential and sustainability; these were the core issues for building the ReInHerit digital ecosystem and management model. This phase developed a set of requirements that paved the roadmap for an impactful implementation for the second phase, which included the development of the ReInHerit Toolkit and Digital Hub, and, finally, the pilot phase where stakeholders were provided with access to the Toolkit through the Digital Hub and additional testing, workshops and hackathons took place for interacting with potential users and evaluating the projects’ outcomes.</p>\n<p>In this project, sustainability was considered as a medium for developing a long-term strategic heritage management policy that can provide museums and heritage sites (particularly small- and medium-sized) with the abilities to adapt to new audiences, new forms of communication, new organizational structures, and technologies. The utility of the sustainability mind-frame was used to incite rethinking about patterns of consumption and current practices, modes of operation and managerial organization for achieving long-term impact. This was aligned with the need to develop an innovative Digital Hub.  Innovation was understood in the ReInHerit project as an ongoing process that creates new products, methods and/or processes. It is a process of modification, conversion, translation, application in which a creative product is made into something that is concretely useful and has a new value (practice &#x26; improvement). In accordance with OECD (Oslo Manual, 2018), the result of the innovation process is “a new or improved product or process (or combination thereof) that differs significantly from the unit’s previous products or processes and that has been made available to potential users.” An important aspect of innovation in the ReInHerit project was social innovation deriving from the relationship between services/objects and people (how these services are used, their meaning, the relationships between services), which can lead to new ways of inclusion in heritage and improve the welfare and wellbeing of communities. For the European Commission (New European Innovation Agenda, Commission Staff Working Document, 2022, p2), “innovation is key in a global context that can accelerate the transition to sustainable development, while improving our well-being, reducing inequalities and ensuring longer-term prosperity”.</p>\n<p>The adoption of digital technologies (that integrate physical and digital interactions) in museums and heritage sites has been aligned with social innovation:  the democratic and inclusive approach to heritage management that has been taking place in recent decades. ReInHerit project has identified a core issue in this: sustainable digital transformation has not been fully implemented (digital solutions are outsourced and heritage professionals are not active agents in digital transformation) for all museums. Tackling the issue of a sustainable digital transformation can lead to disruptive innovation in cultural heritage management. This means the implementation of solutions that are capable of radically changing the market behavior in the heritage sector for the different stakeholders.\r\nInnovation in ReInHerit addresses a key priority  of the European Commission which is aligned with the New European Innovation Agenda:</p>\n<p>“A Europe fit for the digital age: empowering people with new generation technologies”</p>\n<p>The aim with this priority is to achieve digital transformation that will enhance both economic and environmental efficiency while developing new sustainable, circular and inclusive ways to satisfy human needs and wellbeing. The ReInHerit project contributes to this by providing innovative solutions (processes and products, see figure below) that enables the formation of a sustainable heritage management by creating a guided path through learning resources, prototypes and codes, best practices and handbook, webinars that can help museum and heritage professionals recreate, adopt and adapt the ReInHerit’s Digital Toolkit and exhibitions.</p>","excerpt":"The ReInHerit project (ID No 101004545) was funded under the EU Horizon 2020 Programme as a Coordination and Support Action (hereafter CSA…","frontmatter":{"title":"Collaboration in the ReInHerit Horizon 2020 Project - Redefining the Future of Cultural Heritage, through a disruptive model of sustainability)","pubstatus":"completed","date":"2 days ago","target_audience":["PROFESSIONAL"],"pageId":"6f7aafa2-01df-48a1-9495-44849deba59b","license":"CC BY 2.0","thumbnail":"https://ucarecdn.com/13092fa4-3beb-4822-82b0-89faa8504d92/","abstract":null,"challengesbestpractice":"The main challenges encountered related to the communication between partners in the beginning of the project due to the traveling restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic in the early stages of the project and due to the different approaches to digital technologies stemming from the different disciplinary and cultural backgrounds of the partners.

Various industries contributed to the city's development, which influenced the construction of a road and railway network that connected it to major European centers in the late 19th century. Until 1990, the city was recognized for its continuous industrial and port operations, leading to the construction of various buildings such as warehouses, silos, factory halls, power plants, chimneys, and roads. However, the deindustrialization that followed left many of these buildings abandoned, and the city became known for its derelict industrial structures. In recent years, there has been a concerted effort to research and redevelop these factory premises, which are increasingly undergoing a revitalization process. As a result, these buildings have become a popular destination for tourists visiting Rijeka. Following the success of the website <a href=\"http://www.rijekaheritage.org\">www.rijekaheritage.org</a>, which listed and presented the most significant objects of the industrial heritage of the city, the Center for Industrial Heritage has taken the second step towards showcasing the most important objects of the city's industrial heritage by creating a mobile application called ViaIndustRIa. It offers 8 thematic routes that feature recent buildings of former industrial use. The app tracks the user's current location and suggests the nearest object and starting position of the route. The routes have interesting names like Rijeka Dream, Keeping up with the Wheels, Which Warehouse Have I Left My Keys In?, Launched!, Following the Ships, Oil and Torpedo, From Industry to Culture, One Street So Much History, Short Stories Make History, and Hidden Mills.

In this respect, it is crucial for each them to create a realistic, detailed and sustainable Cultural Heritage Management plan (CHM plan) within the digital transformation and innovation context in order for them to be relevant to contemporary societies.\r\nIn the context of the research project “Redefining the future of cultural heritage, through a disruptive model of sustainability” (ReInHerit project - <a href=\"https://www.reinherit.eu/\">https://www.reinherit.eu/</a>), the University of Nicosia developed a model of how to establish a state-of-the-art CHM plan for museums and CH institutions, which takes into account the latest developments in the field. It brings forward the main issues and principles that need to be taken into account during the drafting procedure of a CHM plan, explores current state-of-affairs of professional practice in the CH sector across Europe, offers clear and concise information on the CH sector needs, challenges and bottlenecks, and eventually, provides practical recommendations that need to be taken into account so as to support communication between CH professionals and their various audiences, with special focus on young people and local communities.\r\nA CHM plan is a document that explains management issues, approaches and requirements relating to museums and sets a framework for decision making over a given period of time. It is a clear and coherent plan for action, a guide to the future. It identifies areas of strength to build on, weaknesses to be addressed and opportunities to be exploited. Overall, it is a management tool for museums to use in planning their future activities and operations. The main objectives of a CHM plan are: to protect the values of CH for present and future generations, to promote effective sustainability practices, to improve museums’ operation, and to help museums reposition themselves in an ever-changing world, in order to be more relevant and better serve society.\r\nΙn order to prepare a successful CHM plan it is important to look outside the organization and understand how the external environment is changing. In other words, the first crucial step is to understand the needs, challenges and opportunities of this era. An in-depth understanding of the current situation in the CH sector will facilitate CH professionals to develop a CHM plan that provides a vision, aims and actions designed to address these needs. The ReInHerit project mapped the current status quo of the CH sector in Europe in order to provide an overview of the current needs, challenges and opportunities. In a nutshell the following needs were identified: a) Need for interdisciplinary collaboration so as to avoid fragmentation; b) Need to redefine the management of collections based on evolving ethical standards and new trends; c) Need for sustainable business models resilient to changes and crises; d) Need for climate and energy responsible museums; e) Need to redefine the relationship between museums and their various audiences (relevance and inclusivity).\r\nTaking into account the needs and challenges of this era, as well as the potential opportunities, museums should proceed to the second step, which is to design a CHM plan. The design of a CHM plan should be based on: a) a people centered and environmentally friendly approach to CHM with an open minded, “out of the box” and holistic vision; b) a clear orientation towards the ideas of sustainability and resilience as a framework for the development of long-term strategic cultural policies and the rethinking of patterns of consumption and current practices, modes of operation and managerial organization; c) a commitment to the concepts of inclusivity, relevance, innovation, accessibility, democratisation, ethics, diversity, professionalism, cooperation, and community participation; d) a clear vision on the application of digital technologies, which are of relevance to the CH sector.\r\nKey issues in the designing process of a CHM plan are: a) a thorough understanding of the character of the CH (tangible or intangible) to be managed, b) an excellent knowledge of the wide set of legal instruments (hard and soft law ones) for safeguarding CH, c) a knowledge of all resources, both human and financial, and d) a knowledge of the relevant key stakeholders that are involved in the protection and development of CH. However, taking into consideration the “big picture” (needs and challenges), an updated and modern CHM plan should include clear strategies for the following issues: Collections Management, Energy and environmental Management, Intellectual Property (IP) Management,  New ‘Business’ Models and Financing, and Audience engagement.\r\nA CHM plan has the potential to help museums to tackle a complex reality with multiple challenges and bottlenecks that create specific urgent needs. Museums that develop a CHM plan are better prepared for the present and the future and are more likely to engage more people with CH and provide them enjoyable and meaningful experience compared to museums, which continue to follow traditional operating methods that do not respond to the needs of the modern era.</p>","excerpt":"Many museums and cultural heritage (CH) institutions, especially smaller ones, continue to suffer from inefficient management due to lack of…","frontmatter":{"title":"A Sustainable Cultural Heritage Management Plan for Museums","pubstatus":"completed","date":"3 hours ago","target_audience":["PROFESSIONAL","VISITOR"],"pageId":"56b7af6e-6783-4d99-8fa0-2ea228e70641","license":"CC BY 2.0","thumbnail":"https://ucarecdn.com/a149c19a-6d58-45ae-ba00-814cec2b7f4e/","abstract":null,"challengesbestpractice":"In an ever-changing world, where rapid transformations (economic, social, technological, environmental) are taking place, museums and cultural heritage institutions must be constantly vigilant in order to respond to new needs.","desc":"Cultural Heritage Management (CHM) is the main vehicle for helping museums to face challenges, secure sustainable competitiveness, be resilient to climate change, natural hazards and pandemic risks, and redefine themselves in a constantly changing world.

Since the Best Practice focuses on ReInHerit’s exhibitions, students from the History and Archaeology Department of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens were selected due to their relevance with the subject. The students were accompanied by their Museology professor who also participated actively in the discussion. To facilitate the discussion, it is recommended to have between 20 to 30 participants.\r\nThe workshop was divided into two parts. The first part was a theoretical one with presentations by museum staff actively involved in the preparation and organization of the exhibitions and a Q&#x26;A session after the end of the presentations. In the second part of the workshop, students were split into smaller groups. They were asked to discuss different aspects of the exhibitions, brainstorm, take notes and record their answers and feedback. The students produced both written notes and audios.\r\nThe topics discussed with the students were how to bring the exhibitions closer to the younger generations, make them more appealing through new technologies and how social media and TikTok can play an important role for increased younger audience engagement. The relevance of the exhibition themes to their everyday lives was also discussed along with how clear and appealing the concept and its means of presentation are to them.\r\nThis co-creation workshop, the materials and its methodological framework are just an example to follow the flow of the activity. All the material and the equipment could be transferred to different thematic areas and topics, and this is one of the essential assets of this co-creation workshop which focuses on active involvement of the main target group of a product of the cultural sector during its development phase. It could be helpful to organize this event in collaboration with a relevant university department to increase the impact and interdisciplinarity and also enrich the participants’ knowledge in a relevant subject. As mentioned above, the Museum of Cycladic Art collaborated with undergraduate students of History and Archaeology from the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens.</p>\n<p>The first step is for the organizers to present the cultural heritage product and its framework of development in a clear and concise manner. Then, the organizers will need to clearly define what is expected from the students and make sure that everyone understands the value of their contribution.\r\nThe next step is to ask from students to split into four or five groups that they will form as they like, depending on the total number of attendees, so that everyone can actively contribute in the activity.<br>\nAll students will be provided with writing material, and it will be ensured that there are no noise and distractions. It is important that the co-creation workshop is implemented without the intervention of their professor. This way, they will feel free to participate intuitively and without feeling that they are being evaluated for their answers as part of a university assessment.  The comments and answers of the participants will be recorded through notes and audio recordings which they will produce and share with the organizers themselves.\r\nPhotos and videos can be taken, with the consent of all participants, and later being promoted on the social media of the host organization. This is also one of the assets of this best practice as it leads to the involvement of the main target group in the development of an end product through feedback and evaluation and at the same time it raises awareness on it, attracting the targeted community and spreading the word.\r\nAt the end of the activity, the participants will be asked to present the main conclusions of each group and also make suggestions.</p>","excerpt":"The aim of this good practice is the promotion of a cultural heritage product, in this case the ReInHerit Travelling and Digital Exhibitions…","frontmatter":{"title":"Co-creation workshop with university students for improvement and promotion of a cultural heritage product, Travelling and Digital Exhibitions","pubstatus":"completed","date":"5 hours ago","target_audience":["PROFESSIONAL"],"pageId":"ed2d447e-5a12-4ab6-84c0-e35133910a7e","license":"CC BY 2.0","thumbnail":"https://ucarecdn.com/6d012dcb-3689-4735-a85a-db87a1a0f331/","abstract":null,"challengesbestpractice":"The main challenge is to select the right audience with proper background and willingness to contribute.

The mission of the museum is to bring together different people and working in a variety of ways to increase understanding and dialogue between cultures. Participation, pluralism, reciprocity and topicality are key values.</p>\n<p>In 2021-2022 the museum created an empathy game as part of the broader European project “I am European; migrant Stories and Facts for the 21st Century”, which aimed to increase young people’s understanding of migration and to develop the empathy they felt for other people. The concept also included a series of videos and a campaign in which young influencers of migrant background talk about influencing, dreams and wishes, identity issues, studies, working, residency permits, racism and what it is like living in Finland.</p>\n<p>The theme of the empathy enhancing game is the process of applying for a residency permit in Finland. Young asylum seekers were interviewed to collect their experiences, feelings and thoughts on being a refugee, being relocated and going through the process of getting a residence permit. They were also involved in other development stages of the game and were part of the team that ran the game in schools. For students and teachers the game gave them new perspectives on being a refugee. Young people of refugee status felt that the game was an important way to increase dialogue and understanding.

A first attempt at this was the development of an escape game dealing with climate change, also developed for young people.</p>\n<p>Participation is a key part of the museum’s activities. A guiding belief is that by involving communities the museum increases wellbeing, reduces marginalization and helps to nurture peace within society. This is also why the museum does not charge an admission fee because it believes everyone has the right to enjoy cultural activities. Community involvement and co-creation activities with the ethnically diverse groups that reside in the greater Helsinki area is actively maintained through co-curation, getting people involved in planning and doing, facilitating various activities, and sharing the resources of the museum. Active involvement with the originating communities is key, as the museum believes they are the true holders of the Collection. Another form of community engagement that the museum is involved in is its internship programme. The museum offers internships to people of migrant background, who often have a hard time finding employment in Finland.</p>","excerpt":"The Helinä Rautavaara Ethnographic Museum, founded in 1998 is based on the collections of explorer, journalist and collector Helinä…","frontmatter":{"title":"My story, our Europe empathy game for schools and video series on migrant influencers","pubstatus":"completed","date":"an hour ago","target_audience":["PROFESSIONAL"],"pageId":"092a0e2c-bf2a-44ce-b1a8-e69da982552a","license":"CC BY 2.0","thumbnail":"https://ucarecdn.com/5bfb1e01-a609-479c-ad65-3b7a9e5ad873/","abstract":null,"challengesbestpractice":"The project My story, our Europe was launched during the Corona Pandemic which restricted and delayed  its use in schools.
