Once all the poses have been matched, the application allows the user to <strong>generate</strong> a video that can be saved for any <strong>social sharing</strong> and provide info on the artworks. The video shows the user matching process and the overall <strong>interactive experience</strong> lived at the museum.</p>\n<p>As part of the ReinHerit Toolkit, the application is designed for the cultural heritage domain and exploit gamification techniques in order to <strong>improve enjoyment and learning</strong> of museum artworks.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/e374f086-8574-47ba-be80-b9afedbdb597/\" alt=\"Strike a Pose - User Interaction during a test at ACM Multimedia 2022\" title=\"Strike a Pose - User Interaction during a test at ACM Multimedia 2022\"></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Strike a Pose - User Interaction during a test at ACM Multimedia 2022</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/a702cece-212f-4ab9-89b0-b67ebccae21a/\" alt=\"Strike a Pose - User Interaction during a test\" title=\"Strike a Pose - User Interaction during a test\"></p>\n<p>The innovative application promotes a user-centred and <strong>gamification</strong> approach, a process of exploiting game strategies and dynamics in non-game scenarios.
