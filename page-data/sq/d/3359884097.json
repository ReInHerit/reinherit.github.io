The aim of the Intro- and Outro is to introduce concepts and ideas treated in the exhibitions through their Thematic Areas – Craftsmanship, Conflicts and Identities. The main goal is to give visitors the inspiration to explore their own relationship to the Thematic Areas. Furthermore, the potential for the Intro- and Outro stations to become a connecting element between on-site and online exhibitions was an important focal point in the ideation stage from the beginning.<br>\nThe Intro- and Outro stations where created with this purpose in mind. They are positioned at the entrance and exit to the exhibitions in the on-site Travelling Exhibitions and they are the first, and last pages the visitors navigate to when they click through the online Digital Exhibitions. In the on-site exhibitions, the Intro- and Outro stations are presented on touchscreen displays. At the Outro station, the submission of an answer to the final question takes visitors to a map overview, where they can compare their answers with those of visitors from other Travelling Exhibition locations as well as the audiences of the Digital Exhibitions. This lets the visitor put their answers into a context and allows them to see where other visitors stand on the questions of the Thematic Areas.

The creators describe it as “an apparatus for ideological diagnostics.” It tells you how you think when you think. It asks you questions from everyday contexts and determines from your answers which philosophical convictions guide your thinking. The concept had been used by the ReInHerit Partner Graz Museum in one of their exhibitions before.</p>\n<p>When the decision to use the Philomat was finalized, the ReInHerit Team got in touch with Wolfgang Buschlinger, who elaborated a set of four questions for each of the Thematic Areas of the ReThinking Exhibitions.</p>","excerpt":"As soon as the general concept of the Intro and Outro stations was determined, the ReInHerit Team began to explore possibilities for the…","frontmatter":{"title":"3.
