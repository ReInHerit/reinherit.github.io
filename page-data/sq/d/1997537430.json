It helps define the scope of the game and sets the general direction for the project, keeping the entire team on the same page. The GDD is created and edited by the development team and is primarily used in the video game industry to organize efforts within a development team. It covers the core concept, plot, characters, game mechanics, and more. A well-crafted GDD acts like a guide, ensuring everyone on the team is on the same page. It should be thorough and specific enough to let a team of people build a cohesive, consistent game.\r\nIn essence, a GDD takes out most of the guesswork and informs every decision the team makes. Despite some arguments against the use of GDDs, they can be very helpful if done correctly, especially for complicated concepts.</p>\n<p>This particular GDD, documents the development of the \"Museum Management Game\" of the ReInHerit project as this was done by the team from <a href=\"http://www.cyens.org.cy/\">CYENS - Centre of Excellence</a>.</p>","excerpt":"A game design document (GDD) is a software design document that serves as a blueprint from which a game is to be built.

In the case of the ReInHerit game, the UI has been carefully designed to facilitate easy navigation, effective communication of game information, and intuitive interaction with the game elements. This blog post will explore the various aspects of the user interface in the ReInHerit game and how they contribute to enhancing the overall user experience.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Start UI:</strong> The start screen of the game sets the tone for the player's journey. In the ReInHerit game, the start UI is clean and visually appealing, with four buttons - Play, Quit, Continue, and Options. The buttons are clearly labeled and positioned for easy access. The \"Play\" button starts the game from the beginning, while the \"Quit\" button closes the game.  The \"Continue\" button allows players to resume the game from a previously saved state, and the \"Options\" button provides options to adjust game volume and graphics quality.</li>\n<li><strong>Game UI:</strong> The game UI in the ReInHerit game is designed to provide players with all the necessary information and controls to navigate and interact with the game world.  The main components of the game UI include:\r\n(1) This component displays important information such as the current round, available in-game money, score, and total number of visitors.  It helps players track their progress and make informed decisions.  (2) This button allows players to save the current state of the game.  It provides a sense of control and allows players to continue their progress from where they left off.\r\n(3) This button enters the player into building mode, where they can add new rooms, delete existing rooms, and connect rooms with doors.  The dropdown list provides a range of options for room manipulation, and players can execute their chosen action by clicking and dragging on the blue grid.\r\n(4) This button enters the player into curating mode, where they can select artifacts from their inventory and place them in the museum.  It allows players to showcase their collection and create an engaging museum experience.\r\n(5) This button changes the museum's state to open, allowing visitors to enter and explore the museum.  It signifies a milestone in the game progression and adds a sense of achievement.\r\n(6) This slider enables players to speed up the game, allowing them to progress at their desired pace.  It provides flexibility and customization options for players.</li>\n<li><strong>Artifact Control:</strong> In the ReInHerit game, players can interact with placed artifacts in the museum.  When an artifact is clicked, a set of options is presented to the player.  These options include entering observation mode, upgrading the artifact's case, modifying its position, and cleaning the artifact.  These interactions add depth to the gameplay and allow players to engage with the artifacts on a more personal level.</li>\n<li><strong>High-Quality Art and Animation:</strong>  The user interface of the ReInHerit game is visually appealing, with high-quality art and animations.  The use of generative AI tools like Midjourney and Stable Diffusion has allowed for the creation of unique and visually stunning images and icons.  The character animations, created using Mixamo and Unity's Third Person Controller, provide lifelike movements and enhance the overall immersion of the game.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The user interface of the ReInHerit game has been thoughtfully designed to enhance the user experience.  From the start screen to the in-game UI elements, every aspect has been carefully considered to provide players with a seamless and enjoyable gaming experience.  The clean and intuitive design, coupled with high-quality art and animations, contributes to the overall immersion and engagement of players.</p>","excerpt":"The user interface (UI) of a game plays a crucial role in providing an immersive and enjoyable experience for players.

As part of the project, a web-based video  game has been developed to provide an interactive and engaging experience for users, including the general public and cultural heritage professionals.  This blog post provides an <strong>overview</strong> of the development process and concept of a story-based interactive game focused on cultural management and utilizing cultural heritage assets.  The game aims to increase awareness and appreciation for EU culture and targets players over the age of 13.</p>\n<p><strong>The team:</strong> The game development involved a multidisciplinary team composed of technical and cultural heritage professionals.  The technical team consisted of digital artists and developers from CYENS – Centre of Excellence, while the cultural heritage professionals from the Bank of Cyprus Cultural Foundation had expertise in cultural heritage management, archaeology, history, and curation.  The team worked together to ensure a technically sound game while maintaining historical and archaeological accuracy.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/40318658-eb5e-4f3b-b62d-395870e9d76c/\" alt=\"Brainstorming sessions with representatives of BOCCF and CYENS \" title=\"Brainstorming sessions with representatives of BOCCF and CYENS \"></p>\n<p><strong>Game concept:</strong> The game revolves around museum management.  Players assume the role of a museum director and make decisions that shape and curate the museum experience for visitors.  The success of the museum determines the player's progress and rewards in the game.  The concept was inspired by games like Idle Museum Tycoon, Roller Coaster Tycoon, Two Point Hospital, and Theme Hospital.  The goal is to create a simulation game that allows players to create their own emergent story and learn about museum design and management in a fun and creative way.</p>\n<p><strong>Game flow:</strong>  The game starts with a splash screen and menu options for starting a new game, loading a saved session, adjusting game settings, or quitting the game.  The player serves as the protégé of the Bank of Cyprus Cultural Foundation Director and is tasked with running the museum for a month to prove their worthiness.  The game progresses through rounds, with players managing the museum in closed and open modes.  In the open mode, visitors come to the museum to view exhibits, and events occur that can have positive or negative effects on the museum.  The game continues until the player either wins by meeting certain conditions or loses by bankruptcy or low ratings.</p>\n<p>The game has specific <strong>rules</strong> that control the players' actions and define the objectives and consequences of their actions.  The winning condition is met when players reach a certain number of rounds without failing conditions such as bankruptcy or low ratings.  The museum can be opened or closed based on certain conditions, and the game includes task difficulty that increases as players progress, requiring more budget, maintenance, and artifact placement.</p>\n<p>The game also includes various roles such as the museum director (controlled by the player), architect (for building custom museums), curator (responsible for placing artifacts), keepers (workers who move artifacts), visitors (controlled by AI and assess the player's performance), conservators (restore artifacts), and janitors (keep the museum clean).  Each role has its own responsibilities and contributes to the overall gameplay experience.</p>","excerpt":"The ReInHerit project aims to redefine the future of cultural heritage through a disruptive model of sustainability.
