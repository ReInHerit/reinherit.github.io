Both organisations cover parts of the industrial and mining area. The LEADER region includes 17 municipalities, the largest being the town of Leoben. It is the regions administrative, economic, urban and cultural centre with about 25.000 inhabitants. Furthermore, it is home to a polytechnical university, specialising in mining, metallurgy and material sciences. Also, the iron ore mountain still operates, being the biggest ore mining site in in Europe. Other industries are also still in place with the VOEST Alpine steel maker, being the one with the most international recognition.</p>\n<p>In 2004, 12 regional museums in the region agreed to pool their resources and to form the Museum Association Steirische Eisenstrasse (Museumsverbund). The network is mostly composed of smaller heritage institutions with a narrow thematic focus. The overall aim of the cooperation is to raise the visiblity of the different small museums in the area and improve the cultural offer via the pooling of resources, the support for joint funding applications, and knowledge exchange between the participating institutions.</p>\n<p>At the centre of the association is the MuseumCentre Leoben/Kunsthalle, which is situated in the regional capital and has the biggest numbers of staff and visitors, providing stable and professional structures for the network. This is especially important in the regional context, as the themes covered by the different regional museums are wide, but their organisational structures are similar: they are mostly based on voluntary work, which leads to little time and workforce for new concept development or proper archiving. In this case, the association helps to maintain and improve the offer of the single museums without threatening their unique displays and themes by sharing staff and experiences, as well as lobbying for joint funding. Additionally, the association undertakes joint marketing efforts, constituting an umbrella brand and a platform, for shared marketing and therefore helping to raise the profile and the outreach of the regional offer mainly in a national context.</p>\n<p>Due to the established network and exchange, the institutions now profit from an increased quality of their exhibitions, new funding, an increased outreach and joint archiving efforts. Overall, the cooperation has helped to build capacities in a rather dispersed heritage landscape outside the tourism mainstream, marked by many small, volunteer-based cultural institutions. Since 2016 the museum association, together with the „Abenteuer Erzberg”, is part of the European Route of Industrial Heritage (ERIH), further raising the profile of the cultural offer in the region.</p>\n<p>Thereby, the Erzberg is one of the few public accessible surface mines of its kind in Europe and constitutes a USP. Also, a range of sports related offers are available, with the annual motocross event „Erzbergrodeo\" taking place right in the Erzberg mine. Furthermore, also the „Rostfest”, an already well established and known festival full of music, art interventions and discussions with links to the region´s industrial heritage takes place. All and foremost it aims at exchange through creativity: Visitors talking with residents, thereby learning more about the region, providing impetus for participation and creative outputs. A best practice for regional development in peripheral areas through culture and tourism.

Dating back in history to the 8th century, Franks in the west and Avars in the east began building two opposite defence lines, spreading from the outskirts of the Alps to the Drava River in the south. The area was long considered a bridge between middle and South-Eastern Europe and witnessed notable battles by the Holy Roman Empire, Mongols, Osmans and other peoples (unfolding over a period of over 1,000 years) for the dominance over this territory. This border area is a rich of notable remnants from these times and prominent for having one of the highest numbers of such defence constructions in the whole of Europe.</p>\n<p>Thirty years ago, the castles and mansions in South-Eastern Austria decided to cooperate within a ”Castle Road” association (”Die Schlösserstraße”). Nevertheless, it was realised that without the inclusion of castles and mansions from both Slovenia and Austria, a comprehensive presentation of the border area’s most remarkable turning points and diverse history would not be possible. Therefore, the association now also includes members from Slovenia. The association now counts 41 castles, palaces and monasteries that once served as manors or for military protection.</p>\n<p>The establishment and development of this cooperation was realized within the context of the European funding programme INTERREG Austria-Slovenia ”Establishment of a cross-border sustainable association involving castle and castles in the cross-border area of Slovenia and Austria”. More precisely, the project was financially supported by the EU INTERREG SI-AT programme (EUR 978,664.60). Three public project partners were involved: the Research and Educational Centre Mansion Rakičan (Slovenia), the Technologiezentrum Deutschlandsberg GmbH (Austria) as well as the ”Stiftung des weiland Fürst Philipp Batthyány zur Erhaltung der alten Güssinger Burg” (Austria). In additions, the following 32 forts, mansions and castles that once formed the historic castle ring confirmed their participation in the project: Aichberg, Deutschlandsberg, Feldbach, Fürstenfeld, Gleichenberg, Gornja Radgona, Grad, Güssing, Hartberg, Herberstein, Kapfenstein, Kornberg, Lendava, Lockenhaus, Negova, Neuhaus, Obermayerhofen, Ormož, Ottersbach, Piber, Pöllau, Ptuj, Rače, Radkersburg, Rakičan, Riegersburg, Schielleiten, Schlaining, Seggau, Slovenska Bistrica, Tabor and Welsdorf. As the project unfolded, other castles and mansions were invited to join. The purpose of the Schlösserstrasse is to preserve and strengthen these historic sites in order to continue and enhance the valuable tourist cultural and educational offer to young and adult visitors, and strengthen the reach and appeal of this route for international tourists.\r\nEspecially the cooperation through the joint INTERREG project served the following goals:</p>\n<p>•\tTo develop a common brand for this association of castles and sites, which will ensure increased international visibility and promotion.\r\n•\tTo propose cross-border cultural packages, in combination with regional thermal hotels, as part of the promotion.\r\n•\tTo cooperate with international media and culture specialized tourist agencies in promoting these sites and the Castle Road.\r\n•\tTo produce targeted material for different visitors, in particular with a focus on guidance for families and content for children, contributing to the additional attractiveness of the region for this target group.\r\n•\tTo foster the international promotion of the route as a unique cultural heritage experience, encouraging more guests to visit the region and the different sites within it.</p>\n<p>These well-preserved locations now serve as excursion destinations, museums or event venues. As valuable cultural jewels, these residences impress a broad spectrum of visitors every year. Supplemented by partnerships with regional businesses in the fields of health, culinary, culture and exercise, the Schlösserstrasse offers visitors a broad range of opportunities for discovery and relax, as well as heritage experiences. Each of the members designs and develops its own historical utilization concept, resulting in a wide range of completely different, yet complementary tourist and cultural offerings. What they all have in common is that their offer is embedded in the existing historic buildings. The offer at the Schlösserstrasse includes an invitation to explore the diversity of the houses and is presented as a recommendation for further engaging with this rich heritage landscape and the history of the region.</p>\n<p>Specific outputs of the cross-border cooperation were:</p>\n<p>•\tCultural Offer Folder\r\nThe aim of the intensive exchange between the partner destinations was to design a folder listing all the partners’ offer and detailing the target groups, so to specifically address the different needs of visitors. The possibilities for experiences along the Schlösserstrasse includes: lively music and entertainment; balloon rides; guided tours in museums, crypts, and medieval city centres; wine tasting; treasure hunting games for children; and hosting a wedding reception on site. In the folder, five different travel itineraries were presented: “Grand Castle Tour” focused on music experiences; “Notable Castle Tour” focused on art collections; “Enchanting Castle Road”, focused on gardens and architecture; “Magical Castle Road”, focused on suggestive experiences; “Heroic Castle Road”, focused on fortified sites. The folder also includes information about the sites with their offer (events, guided tours, gastronomy and overnight accommodation options).</p>\n<p>•\tSchlösserstrasse Quiz\r\nIn order to train staff at these heritage sites  and expand their knowledge on relevant features of the route and its cultural monuments, a bilingual quiz was developed. It includes a total of 114 questions covering general topics of the Schlösserstrasse as well as location specific ones. The main target group of the quiz are employees in the regions of Styria, southern Burgenland and Slovenia who are in direct contact with visitors on a daily basis. After successfully answering at least 80% of the questions, participants receive a certificate that identifies them as an expert on the respective Schlösserstrasse route.</p>\n<p>Overall, the establishment of the transnational castle route shows the potential of forming a transnational, cross-border tourism product, which has a direct impact on single locations, as well as the overall development of the regions and their tourism offer.</p>","excerpt":"The ”Castle Road” is a cross-border route, which incorporates an area with one of the highest density of castles and palaces in Europe…","frontmatter":{"title":"A sustainable cooperation between heritage sites (castles) for the joint development and marketing of cross-border heritage tourism","pubstatus":"completed","date":"3 months ago","target_audience":["PROFESSIONAL"],"pageId":"eff98bfc-7335-4588-9ba6-7192ce0085f4","license":"CC BY 2.0","thumbnail":"https://ucarecdn.com/603bd9e6-4500-4ec6-8b85-0b569874ad5b/","abstract":null,"challengesbestpractice":"The cooperation across national border is always a challenging task: language barriers, different organisational cultures and responsibilities, as well as different administrative contexts complicate cooperation also in the heritage sector – usually regarded as a ’soft’ cooperation field.

Thirty years ago, in order to combine their touristic and cultural offer, castles from the regions  of Eastern Styria and Southern Burgenland (Austria) formed the association of the ”Castle Road” (”Die Schlösserstrasse”). To ensure further success, as well as to highlight the European dimension, new (transnational) strategies were needed. Therefore, through the INTERREG SI-AT ”Castle Road” project Slovenian and Austrian partners explored the joint history and culture of their castles and actively linked them from an academic and tourism perspective. This included the development of special, cross-border adventure and tourism products, resulting in a cross-border association connecting both countries and enabling joint marketing activities.","emailbestpractice":"jasmin.sandriester@uni-graz.at","formtypbestpractice":"Cooperation between Museums and Heritage sites","infosbestpractice":"n/a","keywordsbestpractice":"Cultural institutions, joint marketing, cultural management, cross-border cooperation","locationbestpractice":"Transnational cooperation between Austria and Slovenia, including 37 heritage sites","orgbestpractice":"Association ”Die Schlösserstraße“, Konsul Mag.

In terms of tourism, an increase in overnight stays and visits is a witness of the success of this branding and marketing strategy. Local offer has been complemented by itinerary suggestions connecting more sites, of enjoying e-bike tours, the possibility of offering new experiences, and new activities for children and families. The project website offers an overview of such possibilities encouraging visitors to participate and visit more than one site. For example, the possibility of getting married in one of the many castles’ chapels present in the different sites has led to over 600 marriages being celebrated every year in these chapels.   Finally, tourism organisations and stakeholders in the region also benefit from the enhanced attention for these sites, with local hotels, restaurants, and shops enjoying the increased visitor numbers.","timebestpractice":"2018 – 2022","transferbestpractice":" A joint association across heritage sites can be an important step to preserve cultural heritage, improve museum management and collaboration in a region, creating a more attractive and visible offer for visitors.

While funding is essential to setup the association and develop the initial common approach, once established such association has the potential to bring benefit to the whole region. The potential for transfer the forms of collaboration of the Castle Road is therefore high, by supporting similar heritage sites across a region in connecting and developing a common brand and principles for their marketing offer.","urlsbestpractice":"www.schloesserstrasse.com","theme":"Tourism","type":"bestpractice"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p>The CCCB’s Alzheimer Programme was created in October 2010 by a group of workers from the Centre with the aim of bringing art and culture closer to people suffering the initial stages of the disease, as well as for their carers and family members.

This archaeological heritage also has an important role in promoting and encouraging cultural tourism. If it is presented in an attractive way, it can become a sustainable cultural resource. However, the potential of the Danube's archaeological heritage is difficult to exploit, due to scarce visibility and a disunity of the sites.</p>\n<p>There are, of course, common issues in archaeological heritage, and not only isolated issues of the Danube's region. Usually, archaeological heritage is largely hidden underground. Even where there are some archaeological remains above the surface (e.g. in the form of ramparts, burial mounds or stone monuments) these sites are often covered by vegetation, so they are not fully accessible. In addition, it is difficult for the common visitor to imagine how the remains we witness today belonged to buildings and settlements in the past. Besides this lack of visibility, archaeological heritage also finds challenges because of a disunity: archaeological finds are usually located in museums, far from their find spots. Under these circumstances, it is challenging for visitors to understand the archaeological context and the history of these remains and the artefacts displayed at a distance from their original place. Furthermore, sites are not isolated places in space, but are integrated into archaeological landscapes.</p>\n<p>With all these considerations in mind, the project’s aim was to make the archaeological landscapes of the Danube region more visible at the regional, national and international level, and thus more attractive supporting the development of sustainable cultural heritage tourism. Indeed, museums as heritage preservers, interpreters and hotspots of cultural tourism have the power to contribute to a sustainable development of archaeological landscapes.</p>\n<p>Museums and landscapes are strongly interdependent, more than it is perceivable at the first glance. On one hand, museums are interpreters of history and transmitters of knowledge, and so they can promote landscapes in order to increase visitors to those places. On the other hand, landscapes give museums the possibility to contextualise objects and enable people to better understand and value heritage. A successful connection between sustainable tourism, heritage research and interpretation appears to be the future of heritage and landscape preservation.</p>\n<p>The EU INTERREG project “Danube's Archaeological eLandscapes” was implemented by a collaboration of various institutions, researchers, public and stakeholders from ten countries of the regions: Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Germany, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia and Serbia. In particular, there are 10 project partners and 12 associated strategic partner institutions, led by the archaeology team of the Universalmuseum Joanneum (Austria).</p>\n<p>The partners divided themselves in three international working groups in order to focus on different parts of the projects, and then they combined their research in three international studies, in particular: archaeological, technical and social aspects of the project. The aims of the archaeology's group were to support partners in the development of state-of-the-art digital visualisations of archaeological landscapes, sites or objects, based on scientific data. The second group evaluated the costs and benefits of technological solutions for the development and presentation of archaeological visualisations and their promotion across the partner institutions, considering in particular virtual and augmented reality applications. The third group, focused on public archaeology aspects, analysing the social aspects of archaeological heritage, like accessibility, digital visibility, etc. These studies defined the basis for the implementation of digital technologies in the promotion of archaeological heritage in the Danube region.</p>\n<p>In order to offer visitors the possibility to understand the context of archaeological heritage, the project drew on new digital technologies like virtual and augmented reality with the aim to enable their visitors to experience virtually the archaeological artefacts in their original landscapes. At each participant organisation, visitors had the opportunity to explore not only the archaeological landscapes of their own country, but also those of the partner countries - through a combination of touch screens, apps, and augmented and virtual reality stations. In doing so, the project is thus creating Danube's Archaeological eLandscapes bringing researchers and audiences from across the geographic and institutional landscapes together, to share and enjoy the knowledge about the region’s archaeological past.</p>\n<p>The project was planned considering the goals stated above, and it included - as mentioned - working groups covering interdisciplinary aspects of the virtual visualization of cultural heritage (interpretation; technology; audiences). It is common to think about virtual visualizations of cultural heritage sites as simply presenting virtual 3D models. However, when dealing with virtual visualizations, it is necessary to take a more interdisciplinary approach, so to consider the sources and content of the visualisation (based on the archaeological sources and the interpretation needed by the target groups), the possibilities and limitation of the technologies (including costs, technical development, and sustainability), and the audience’s responses to different technological approach and to online communication by archaeological museums and researchers.</p>\n<p>The project’s work plan consisted of nine key steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Project Planning: selection of archaeological (cultural heritage), technical, and social strategies;</li>\n<li>Data Acquisition: gathering of data through active near &#x26; remote sensing techniques, passive near &#x26; remote sensing techniques, legacy data digitisation, analogies research etc.;</li>\n<li>First Interpretation: archaeological/cultural heritage interpretation with the focus on virtual digital enhancement;</li>\n<li>3D Model Creation: integration of data, virtual reproduction, and virtual reconstruction;</li>\n<li>Communication Strategy: selection of best communication channels and file formats;</li>\n<li>Second Interpretation: design of a storyline;</li>\n<li>3D Model Adjustment: adjusting of the 3D model according to expert demands and chosen format, and post-processing of the renderings;</li>\n<li>Dissemination: finished communication formats (and their use);</li>\n<li>Documentation: documenting para- and metadata.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The project developed a set of applications following the above workflow. It also relied on digital storytelling methods to foster engagement with the presentation. Digital storytelling can help not only to build memories and instil values, but it can also educate about our shared obligation to preserve these memories and our archaeological heritage.</p>\n<p>The project included knowledge exchange workshops and mobility actions for the participant organisations, often in parallel to training and discussion events for local museum and heritage professionals. In parallel, exhibitions testing and showcasing the technological solutions were opened at all the museums, and were evaluated through an international visitor survey aiming to investigate the effect of the different applications on their audiences.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/d6f0c083-59c2-40d0-acce-778af4b06bd6/\" alt=\"\"></p>","excerpt":"The Danube region has a rich and culturally diverse archaeological heritage, which is a testimony of cultural and social development, as…","frontmatter":{"title":"Danube´s Archaeological eLandscapes.

Long-term data management plans for digital models are also often missing, database models are inadequate for this type of resources, and copyright and access policies need to be agreed upon. Current digital archaeology work is aiming to tackle these challenges and this project contributed to raise capability and expertise among the participating organisations.   Furthermore, virtual visualisations are difficult to create because they have to be scientifically credible while attracting and engaging their audience: the survey conducted in this project aimed to test reactions to different solutions in order to evaluate the success and limitations of the visualisations.  Finally, the digital tools used in museums for exhibition purposes require systematic funding for long-term maintenance and a sustainable infrastructure (like virtual platforms, websites, databases, podcasts, etc.), but long-term funding is usually pretty rare.

Various industries contributed to the city's development, which influenced the construction of a road and railway network that connected it to major European centers in the late 19th century. Until 1990, the city was recognized for its continuous industrial and port operations, leading to the construction of various buildings such as warehouses, silos, factory halls, power plants, chimneys, and roads. However, the deindustrialization that followed left many of these buildings abandoned, and the city became known for its derelict industrial structures. In recent years, there has been a concerted effort to research and redevelop these factory premises, which are increasingly undergoing a revitalization process. As a result, these buildings have become a popular destination for tourists visiting Rijeka. Following the success of the website <a href=\"http://www.rijekaheritage.org\">www.rijekaheritage.org</a>, which listed and presented the most significant objects of the industrial heritage of the city, the Center for Industrial Heritage has taken the second step towards showcasing the most important objects of the city's industrial heritage by creating a mobile application called ViaIndustRIa. It offers 8 thematic routes that feature recent buildings of former industrial use. The app tracks the user's current location and suggests the nearest object and starting position of the route. The routes have interesting names like Rijeka Dream, Keeping up with the Wheels, Which Warehouse Have I Left My Keys In?, Launched!, Following the Ships, Oil and Torpedo, From Industry to Culture, One Street So Much History, Short Stories Make History, and Hidden Mills.

Aligned with CSA, the aim of the project was to create a model of sustainable heritage management for fostering a digital dynamic European network of heritage stakeholders through the Digital Hub. The ReInHerit Digital Hub provides to relevant stakeholders (museums, heritage sites, policy makers, professionals and communities) with the tools and resources to communicate, experiment, innovate and disseminate European cultural heritage.</p>\n<p>To achieve this, the project was implemented by adopting a bottom-up approach, meaning that involved the consortium partners and external museum and heritage professionals from the beginning. The collaboration in the project was divided into three phases. The aim of the first phase was to identify the sector’s needs, challenges and practices across Europe by using quantitative and qualitative research methods (desk research, focus group interviews and questionnaires). During this phase the consortium partners held multiple ideation workshops for formulating the focus group interview questions and the questionnaires to gain information from professionals and visitors with the aim on how to develop the Digital Hub and its resources. A comprehensive map of the stakeholder’s practices and perceptions on European cultural heritage was created with the produced (qualitative and quantitative data) and allowed the partners responsible for developing the exhibitions and the digital apps to (cross)examine the needs, challenges and practices of the sector across different levels.  In doing so, the consortium collected important information on the digital transformation of heritage sites and museums, its impact, innovation potential and sustainability; these were the core issues for building the ReInHerit digital ecosystem and management model. This phase developed a set of requirements that paved the roadmap for an impactful implementation for the second phase, which included the development of the ReInHerit Toolkit and Digital Hub, and, finally, the pilot phase where stakeholders were provided with access to the Toolkit through the Digital Hub and additional testing, workshops and hackathons took place for interacting with potential users and evaluating the projects’ outcomes.</p>\n<p>In this project, sustainability was considered as a medium for developing a long-term strategic heritage management policy that can provide museums and heritage sites (particularly small- and medium-sized) with the abilities to adapt to new audiences, new forms of communication, new organizational structures, and technologies. The utility of the sustainability mind-frame was used to incite rethinking about patterns of consumption and current practices, modes of operation and managerial organization for achieving long-term impact. This was aligned with the need to develop an innovative Digital Hub.  Innovation was understood in the ReInHerit project as an ongoing process that creates new products, methods and/or processes. It is a process of modification, conversion, translation, application in which a creative product is made into something that is concretely useful and has a new value (practice &#x26; improvement). In accordance with OECD (Oslo Manual, 2018), the result of the innovation process is “a new or improved product or process (or combination thereof) that differs significantly from the unit’s previous products or processes and that has been made available to potential users.” An important aspect of innovation in the ReInHerit project was social innovation deriving from the relationship between services/objects and people (how these services are used, their meaning, the relationships between services), which can lead to new ways of inclusion in heritage and improve the welfare and wellbeing of communities. For the European Commission (New European Innovation Agenda, Commission Staff Working Document, 2022, p2), “innovation is key in a global context that can accelerate the transition to sustainable development, while improving our well-being, reducing inequalities and ensuring longer-term prosperity”.</p>\n<p>The adoption of digital technologies (that integrate physical and digital interactions) in museums and heritage sites has been aligned with social innovation:  the democratic and inclusive approach to heritage management that has been taking place in recent decades. ReInHerit project has identified a core issue in this: sustainable digital transformation has not been fully implemented (digital solutions are outsourced and heritage professionals are not active agents in digital transformation) for all museums. Tackling the issue of a sustainable digital transformation can lead to disruptive innovation in cultural heritage management. This means the implementation of solutions that are capable of radically changing the market behavior in the heritage sector for the different stakeholders.\r\nInnovation in ReInHerit addresses a key priority  of the European Commission which is aligned with the New European Innovation Agenda:</p>\n<p>“A Europe fit for the digital age: empowering people with new generation technologies”</p>\n<p>The aim with this priority is to achieve digital transformation that will enhance both economic and environmental efficiency while developing new sustainable, circular and inclusive ways to satisfy human needs and wellbeing. The ReInHerit project contributes to this by providing innovative solutions (processes and products, see figure below) that enables the formation of a sustainable heritage management by creating a guided path through learning resources, prototypes and codes, best practices and handbook, webinars that can help museum and heritage professionals recreate, adopt and adapt the ReInHerit’s Digital Toolkit and exhibitions.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/8566cb47-4ecb-4d73-85b9-11a753841a39/\" alt=\"\"></p>","excerpt":"The ReInHerit project (ID No 101004545) was funded under the EU Horizon 2020 Programme as a Coordination and Support Action (hereafter CSA…","frontmatter":{"title":"Collaboration in the ReInHerit Horizon 2020 Project - Redefining the Future of Cultural Heritage, through a disruptive model of sustainability)","pubstatus":"completed","date":"a month ago","target_audience":["PROFESSIONAL"],"pageId":"6f7aafa2-01df-48a1-9495-44849deba59b","license":"CC BY 2.0","thumbnail":"https://ucarecdn.com/794e672d-5426-4ea5-b2fb-8c5a1d140687/","abstract":null,"challengesbestpractice":"The main challenges encountered related to the communication between partners in the beginning of the project due to the traveling restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic in the early stages of the project and due to the different approaches to digital technologies stemming from the different disciplinary and cultural backgrounds of the partners.

Since the Best Practice focuses on ReInHerit’s exhibitions, students from the History and Archaeology Department of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens were selected due to their relevance with the subject. The students were accompanied by their Museology professor who also participated actively in the discussion. To facilitate the discussion, it is recommended to have between 20 to 30 participants.\r\nThe workshop was divided into two parts. The first part was a theoretical one with presentations by museum staff actively involved in the preparation and organization of the exhibitions and a Q&#x26;A session after the end of the presentations. In the second part of the workshop, students were split into smaller groups. They were asked to discuss different aspects of the exhibitions, brainstorm, take notes and record their answers and feedback. The students produced both written notes and audios.\r\nThe topics discussed with the students were how to bring the exhibitions closer to the younger generations, make them more appealing through new technologies and how social media and TikTok can play an important role for increased younger audience engagement. The relevance of the exhibition themes to their everyday lives was also discussed along with how clear and appealing the concept and its means of presentation are to them.\r\nThis co-creation workshop, the materials and its methodological framework are just an example to follow the flow of the activity. All the material and the equipment could be transferred to different thematic areas and topics, and this is one of the essential assets of this co-creation workshop which focuses on active involvement of the main target group of a product of the cultural sector during its development phase. It could be helpful to organize this event in collaboration with a relevant university department to increase the impact and interdisciplinarity and also enrich the participants’ knowledge in a relevant subject.

In this respect, it is crucial for each them to create a realistic, detailed and sustainable Cultural Heritage Management plan (CHM plan) within the digital transformation and innovation context in order for them to be relevant to contemporary societies.\r\nIn the context of the ReInHerit project, the University of Nicosia developed a model of how to establish a state-of-the-art CHM plan for museums and CH institutions, which takes into account the latest developments in the field. It brings forward the main issues and principles that need to be taken into account during the drafting procedure of a CHM plan, explores current state-of-affairs of professional practice in the CH sector across Europe, offers clear and concise information on the CH sector needs, challenges and bottlenecks, and eventually, provides practical recommendations that need to be taken into account so as to support communication between CH professionals and their various audiences, with special focus on young people and local communities.</p>\n<p><strong>What is a CHM plan?</strong></p>\n<p>A CHM plan is a document that explains management issues, approaches and requirements relating to museums and sets a framework for decision making over a given period of time. It is a clear and coherent plan for action, a guide to the future. It identifies areas of strength to build on, weaknesses to be addressed and opportunities to be exploited. Overall, it is a management tool for museums to use in planning their future activities and operations.</p>\n<p><strong>W﻿hat are the main objectives of a CHM plan?</strong></p>\n<p>The main objectives of a CHM plan are: to protect the values of CH for present and future generations, to promote effective sustainability practices, to improve museums’ operation, and to help museums reposition themselves in an ever-changing world, in order to be more relevant and better serve society.</p>\n<p><strong>What is the first step in preparing a CHM plan?</strong></p>\n<p>Ιn order to prepare a successful CHM plan it is important to look outside the organization and understand how the external environment is changing. In other words, the first crucial step is to understand the needs, challenges and opportunities of this era. An in-depth understanding of the current situation in the CH sector will facilitate CH professionals to develop a CHM plan that provides a vision, aims and actions designed to address these needs. The ReInHerit project mapped the current status quo of the CH sector in Europe in order to provide an overview of the current needs, challenges and opportunities. In a nutshell the following needs were identified:</p>\n<p>a) Need for interdisciplinary collaboration so as to avoid fragmentation;</p>\n<p>b) Need to redefine the management of collections based on evolving ethical standards and new trends;</p>\n<p>c) Need for sustainable business models resilient to changes and crises;</p>\n<p>d) Need for climate and energy responsible museums;</p>\n<p>e) Need to redefine the relationship between museums and their various audiences (relevance and inclusivity).</p>\n<p><strong>What are the major issues that almost every CHM plan should address?</strong></p>\n<p>Taking into account the needs and challenges of this era, as well as the potential opportunities, museums should proceed to the second step, which is to design a CHM plan. The design of a CHM plan should be based on:</p>\n<p>a) a people centered and environmentally friendly approach to CHM with an open minded, “out of the box” and holistic vision;</p>\n<p>b) a clear orientation towards the ideas of sustainability and resilience as a framework for the development of long-term strategic cultural policies and the rethinking of patterns of consumption and current practices, modes of operation and managerial organization;</p>\n<p>c) a commitment to the concepts of inclusivity, relevance, innovation, accessibility, democratisation, ethics, diversity, professionalism, cooperation, and community participation;</p>\n<p>d) a clear vision on the application of digital technologies, which are of relevance to the CH sector.</p>\n<p>Key issues in the designing process of a CHM plan are:</p>\n<p>a) a thorough understanding of the character of the CH (tangible or intangible) to be managed;</p>\n<p>b) an excellent knowledge of the wide set of legal instruments (hard and soft law ones) for safeguarding CH;</p>\n<p>c) a knowledge of all resources, both human and financial;</p>\n<p>d) a knowledge of the relevant key stakeholders that are involved in the protection and development of CH.</p>\n<p>However, taking into consideration the “big picture” (needs and challenges), an updated and modern CHM plan should include clear strategies for the following issues: Collections Management, Energy and environmental Management, Intellectual Property (IP) Management,  New ‘Business’ Models and Financing, and Audience engagement.</p>\n<p><strong>What is the importance of a CHM plan?</strong></p>\n<p>A CHM plan has the potential to help museums to tackle a complex reality with multiple challenges and bottlenecks that create specific urgent needs. Museums that develop a CHM plan are better prepared for the present and the future and are more likely to engage more people with CH and provide them enjoyable and meaningful experience compared to museums, which continue to follow traditional operating methods that do not respond to the needs of the modern era.</p>","excerpt":"Ιntroduction Many museums and cultural heritage (CH) institutions, especially smaller ones, continue to suffer from inefficient management…","frontmatter":{"title":"A Sustainable Cultural Heritage Management Plan for Museums","pubstatus":"completed","date":"a month ago","target_audience":["PROFESSIONAL","VISITOR"],"pageId":"56b7af6e-6783-4d99-8fa0-2ea228e70641","license":"CC BY 2.0","thumbnail":"https://ucarecdn.com/a149c19a-6d58-45ae-ba00-814cec2b7f4e/","abstract":null,"challengesbestpractice":"In an ever-changing world, where rapid transformations (economic, social, technological, environmental) are taking place, museums and cultural heritage institutions must be constantly vigilant in order to respond to new needs.","desc":"Cultural Heritage Management (CHM) is the main vehicle for helping museums to face challenges, secure sustainable competitiveness, be resilient to climate change, natural hazards and pandemic risks, and redefine themselves in a constantly changing world.

This was highlighted also in the survey conducted, with the vast majority of participants responding that they need to receive training and be provided with practical guidance. In terms of new technologies and digital social innovation, it was made clear that access and openness should be promoted, and investment is needed. Another issue that was underlined related to the environmental sustainability dimension and the cultural heritage – innovation nexus. A holistic approach is what is necessary in the implementation of the EU Green Deal and driving action in line with the SDGs.\r\nFinally, regarding Reinherit, peace, security and sustainability, there are three basic challenges that need to be addressed. Firstly, to ensure that a human centered approach is at the heart of the application of digital solutions and the development of new technologies. Secondly, to facilitate participation and thirdly to involve all stakeholders.\r\nAll the measures and the policies to be implemented should take into account the role of cultural heritage in societies, integrate good practices already in place by international organisations, and last but not least have an integrated approach to culture, cultural values and cultural rights in the sustainable development goals.</p>","excerpt":"The conference \"Cultural heritage, innovation and sustainable development: the contribution of ReΙnΗerit\" organized by the Hellenic…","frontmatter":{"title":"Cultural heritage, innovation and sustainable development: the contribution of ReΙnΗerit","pubstatus":"completed","date":"a month ago","target_audience":["PROFESSIONAL"],"pageId":"e4c902e2-bb4d-4837-b295-e41251df848b","license":"CC BY 2.0","thumbnail":"https://ucarecdn.com/eeda39de-3a9b-49f2-9eb0-53ef72c81101/","abstract":null,"challengesbestpractice":"The challenges encountered relate mainly to the post-conference survey participation.

Its International Consortium consists of 16 institutions from 6 European countries and more over 100 associated partners from 13 European countries. Those include universities and educational institutions, research centres, municipalities, companies, European projects, cultural routes, associations, private and public bodies working in tourism.</p>\n<p>rurAllure was born with the aim of creating a network between territories, pilgrims, tourists, heritage, cultural richness, citizens, and local communities, paying special attention to the involvement of rural areas, while its main phases include: identification of pilot areas and relevant heritage sites; definition of common and communication strategies in each pilot area; development and implementation of a technological platform.</p>\n<p>The pilgrimage routes have undoubtedly become a significant economic and political asset for Europe. On the one hand, the thousands of travellers mobilise substantial resources around them, to the point that the economic impact of pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela alone was estimated to exceed 300 million euros in 2019. On the other hand, since many of the pilgrimage routes are transnational, they act as vehicles for cultural exchange and cross-border relationships. It is no surprise, then, that some routes have received (and are receiving) substantial support from regional, national, and European institutions.</p>\n<p>The rurAllure project addresses one weak point hidden behind this depiction of success: the pilgrimage routes may be traversed by thousands, but their impact is almost exclusively perceived in the places located directly on the paths, rarely permeating into the surrounding rural areas. Thus, entire provinces and regions of a predominantly rural nature, which are facing significant economic and demographic challenges all over Europe – as is the case of the provinces of Ourense and Lugo in the north-west of Spain, not far from Santiago de Compostela – become passive witnesses of the flows of pilgrims, whereas they could add much of content and value to the experiences.</p>\n<p>The opportunity for the project is reinforced by the aim to set the basis for rural communities to develop relevant and cohesive tourist products that may help facing the economic challenges arising with the COVID 19 crisis – considering that tourism is one of the most affected areas, the EU should put strong focus in the future into domestic tourism and well as outdoor activities.</p>\n<p>The goal of rurAllure is to overcome this situation through the allure of the cultural heritage found in the rural environment. The opportunity arises from the fact that pilgrimage is usually planned with some flexibility regarding dates, distances travelled in successive journeys, places to rest, etc. Many pilgrims are amenable to serendipitous findings, too. This makes pilgrimage largely different from other types of cultural and touristic experiences, thus opening possibilities of increasing the numbers of visitors to the least-known heritage sites by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Assembling meaningful cultural experiences with resources found in the rural environment</li>\n<li>Mobilising transportation, accommodation, and dining in one click</li>\n<li>Offering the whole packs to the pilgrims through tailor-made means of promotion</li>\n<li>Creation of a network of pilgrims, tourists, travellers, local stakeholders, heritage and fostering the exchange of knowledge and experience.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The project is developed according to four pilots, which function as \"laboratories of ideas\" within the project and work on different thematic areas in different geographical areas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pilot 1: Literary heritage on the ways to Santiago de Compostela.</li>\n<li>Pilot 2: Thermal heritage and others on the ways to Rome.</li>\n<li>Pilot 3: Ethnographic heritage on the ways to Trondheim.</li>\n<li>Pilot 4: Natural heritage on the ways to Csíksomlyó.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Mapping heritage sites along and in the proximity of the routes constitutes the core of the project’s action. The materials are compiled into a digital repository of cultural points of interest, available both as web platform and mobile application. Pilgrims can use the tool to discover new cultural spots, integrate them into their travel itineraries and share featured travel plans with the community, while private and public stakeholders can contribute to the heritage repository to strengthen the visibility of local resources.</p>\n<p>The project’s innovative approach consists in developing a synergy of slow tourism, rural cultural resources, and digital technology. The rurAllure platform, one of the principal deliverables of the project, is free of charge and brings benefits to a wide range of stakeholders: travellers, willing to diversify their experience with cultural visits; public institutions, seeking to gain a greater visibility for local heritage; private vendors, making part of local tourism infrastructure.</p>\n<p>Finally, the project contributes to Sustainable Development Goals, addressing the greatest modern challenges in the environmental, social, and economic dimensions. The rurAllure project’s impact is particularly evident in the action fields, formulated by SDG n.3: ‘Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages’, SDG n.8: ‘Decent work and economic growth’, SDG n.9: ‘Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation, SDG n.11: ‘Sustainable Cities &#x26; Communities’, SDG n.13’ Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts’, SDG n.17: ‘Partnership for the goals’. The project provides a favourable environment for tourism enterprises in provincial localities, empowers local communities, promotes local culture and products.

This initiative highlights BOCCF’s commitment to encouraging accessibility and inclusivity within cultural spaces, particularly by integrating vulnerable groups into various cultural activities. Rooted in the belief that culture fundamentally defines societal identity, the \"Aisthiseis\" programme represents a transformative endeavor, highlighting the importance of providing inclusive cultural experiences for all. The notable changes instituted within BOCCF, including the introduction of sign language tours and Braille guides, not only meet specific accessibility needs but also elevate the overall cultural experience for the broader public. Going beyond the confines of traditional museum settings, the programme's innovative adaptation ensures inclusivity across diverse cultural contexts, signaling dedication dedication to embracing diversity in all its forms.</p>\n<p>The BOCCF places strong emphasis on the training of its staff, as well as external individuals who express an interest in effectively engaging and catering to various vulnerable groups through the arts and culture. This commitment involves providing comprehensive training programmes that equip both internal personnel and external participants with the necessary knowledge and skills to better understand and meet the needs of diverse individuals through cultural activities. By actively engaging in training initiatives, the BOCCF seeks to enhance the competence of its staff and the wider community, creating an environment that is not only accommodating but also responsive to the unique requirements of these groups. Adopting the importance on training for engaging vulnerable groups through the arts and culture, is a strategic move for small and medium-sized cultural institutions. It not only aligns with societal values but also enhances community connections, visitor experiences, and overall institutional reputation.</p>\n<p>An example of the BOCCF forming a workshop for people who want to engage and cater to various vulnerable groups through the arts and culture, was an art therapy workshop that was held specifically for health professionals (therapists) with the objective of team-building. The prevalent themes that surfaced encompassed trust, collegiality, teamwork, family, and balance. Throughout the workshop, the exploration of synergy occurred through engaging activities such as play, movement, and working with clay material, transitioning from individual experiences to a collective context. The discussions raised various perspectives, realisations, and concepts, emphasising themes of journey, joy, love, balance, and family. As the session concluded, several participants expressed a desire to repeat the workshop, extending it to other groups of health professionals with whom they collaborate in the healthcare field.</p>\n<p>The programme's dedication to tailored workshops, led by skilled professionals, addresses a range of topics including art therapy, museum education, clay therapy, experiential storytelling, and creative writing. These workshops cater to the diverse requirements of vulnerable groups. This ensures a broad array of meaningful connections and outlets for expression. An example of the specialised work carried out in the context of ‘Aisthiseis’ is observed in the art therapy workshop hosted in collaboration with a designated art therapist and the Autism Association Cyprus in Nicosia. Inspired by selected exhibits which ‘reveal their own history,’ the participants played with visual materials, for example through painting, to create material manifestations of their thoughts, feelings, and responses. This session offered the group a safer-practice framework for expressing emotions with colours on paper.</p>\n<p>Another specialised workshop as a part of the ‘Aisthiseis’ programme that took place at the BOCCF, titled \"Feel again\", was an experiential storytelling workshop for pregnant women.<br>\nA professional storyteller and musician guided several expectant mothers on a mystical journey. Latent senses and capabilities were stirred, traversing the various stages of a woman's life. Unraveling the intricacies of the symbolic red thread, participants underwent a distinctive multi-sensory encounter that brought back memories. Throughout this workshop, they interacted with diverse materials and narratives, recalling childhood flavors, mimicking sounds with their bodies, and allowing smells and colors to evoke sensations that encouraged the pregnant women to relive memories. On the whole, these specialised workshops led by skilled professionals can enhance the overall cultural experience for the participants, broaden audience reach, and establish a positive reputation for small to medium-sized cultural institutions.</p>\n<p>The \"Aisthiseis\" project also includes a multi-sensory museum kit that travels to external sites and organisations, expanding the reach of inclusive practices. It aims to bring people who are far from museums in contact with museum objects. The museum kit involves accurate replicas of exhibits from the collections of the Foundation's Archaeological and Coinage Museum, which participants can touch and feel. Some examples of where it has travelled, include the elderly, by offering a workshop in the two units of the Materia Group, Materia and Thalpori, as well as to several summer schools and to the School for the Deaf in Cyprus.</p>\n<p>Crucially, the BOCCF has actively sought collaborations with other organisations. These collaborations play a pivotal role in enhancing the overall visitor experience. By forming such partnerships, the BOCCF not only broadens its impact but also sets a standard for cultural institutions in promoting accessibility, diversity, and inclusivity. These collaborations not only enrich the cultural landscape but also reinforce the idea that cultural institutions can be powerful agents of positive social change.\r\nA notable exemplar of successful collaboration manifests in the partnership between the BOCCF and the School for the Deaf in Cyprus, specifically in the implementation of guided tours featuring sign language interpretation at the Foundation. These tours not only cater to the specific needs of the deaf community but also contribute to raising awareness about the rich cultural offerings available to diverse audiences.</p>\n<p>The volume of workshops conducted—65 in total for the year 2023—attests to the BOCCF's dedication to reaching a broad and diverse audience. In essence, the BOCCF's \"Aisthiseis\" programme serves not merely as a checklist of accessibility measures but as a holistic and integrated model, setting a high standard for creating enriching, accessible, and inclusive cultural spaces.</p>","excerpt":"In the year 2023, the BOCCF emerged as a trailblazer among small to medium-sized cultural institutions in Cyprus through the implementation…","frontmatter":{"title":"Accessibility and inclusivity changes in small and medium-sized cultural institutions","pubstatus":"completed","date":"a month ago","target_audience":["PROFESSIONAL","VISITOR"],"pageId":"62277c63-b321-4544-9e94-fe937de7ec23","license":"CC BY 2.0","thumbnail":"https://ucarecdn.com/9997d04f-6892-4e60-905d-c5b091730cb9/","abstract":null,"challengesbestpractice":"The BOCCF grapples with the challenges inherent in implementing changes which emphasise accessibility and inclusivity, foremost among them being the imperative to attract new audiences and maintain relevance.

These assessment methods encompass diverse aspects, from participant feedback and participation rates to social media engagement.  Feedback: A cornerstone in evaluating the success of BOCCF's initiatives lies in the feedback received from participants. Consistently positive responses underscore participants' satisfaction with the Foundation's inclusive and accessible approach. For instance, the BOCCF held an art therapy workshop aimed for people over 60 years old seeking to connect with themselves and tell their story. Forms were given where the participants were asked to circle how they feel at the beginning and at the end of the workshops, as well as any feedback they had. At the start and at the end of the workshop all participants said that they were ‘very happy’. They also stated that they felt grateful, calm, and highlighted the importance of these workshops for people who are over 60.  Participation Rates: The robust engagement witnessed in the 'Aisthiseis' workshops serves as a compelling metric for success. In the year 2023, a total of 65 'Aisthiseis' workshops were held, indicating widespread community participation. This substantial turnout underscores the Foundation's commitment to inclusivity and accessibility, demonstrating its broad appeal and resonance with diverse audiences. Additionally, the 'Aisthiseis' workshops have seen substantial repeat participations, indicating the programme's enduring success and positive impact. This pattern highlights the sustained interest and enthusiasm generated by these inclusive and innovative cultural initiatives, showcasing the workshops' ability to captivate diverse audiences and provide lasting value to participants.  Social Media and Online Presence: Another dimension in measuring success lies in the BOCCF's social media and online presence. Collaborating with an external marketing agency, the Foundation aims for high engagement on its social media posts. Metrics such as likes, shares, and comments on these platforms provide tangible indicators of the ongoing success and relevance of the ‘Aisthiseis’ programme. Press releases distributed to Cypriot media further contribute to informing and attracting new audiences, enhancing the visibility and impact of the Foundation's cultural initiatives.  Adaptability and Flexibility: Evaluating the success of the programme can also involve measuring its adaptability and flexibility in response to the changing needs and interests of participants, ensuring ongoing relevance. The 'Aisthiseis' project serves as a prime example of impressive adaptability and flexibility, consistently adjusting to the evolving requirements and interests of participants. This interdisciplinary initiative has showcased its ability to modify its offerings, ensuring sustained relevance and dynamism. The workshops, characterised by an innovative approach to cultural engagement, underscore a commitment to adaptability, allowing the programme to connect with diverse audiences and cater to emerging preferences. By remaining responsive to the continually shifting landscape of cultural interests, the 'Aisthiseis' project sustains its efficacy and appeal, presenting a paradigm of adaptability and flexibility within the cultural institution's endeavors.

Below, these methods will be analysed in three different sections. The first section will explore the educational programmes provided by the BOCCF. The second section will analyse the implementation of the aforementioned values in BOCCF ‘Aisthiseis’ (‘Senses’) workshops (This programme aims to remove some of the barriers faced by vulnerable people for the benefit of us all and with a view to designing a better and fairer society). Finally, the third section will delineate how these values feature in collaborations between BOCCF and other institutions.</p>\n<p>Through its educational programmes, the BOCCF has introduced a range of inventive and targeted initiatives with the aim of connecting the young population of Cyprus to the realms of art, literature, and civilization. Over 100,000 students have been able to expand their understanding of Cyprus' history and civilization, as well as that of other nations. These multidisciplinary initiatives not only provide valuable knowledge but also offer students unique and unparalleled aesthetic encounters. Currently there are four educational programmes running at the BOCCF, all approved by the Ministry of Education, Sport and Youth. One example is the educational programme titled “Form and shape in soil\" which focuses on the ancient ceramic art of Cyprus. During the session, children explore the world of ancient Cypriot ceramic art, looking into its evolution through the archaeological collection at the BOCCF. Students gain insights into the production process, dyeing techniques, and clay properties, learning about the natural resources used as raw materials. The programme also showcases how natural stones add colour to clay and the subsequent creative processes. To comprehend the historical development of ancient ceramics, children examine figurines and vases from the archaeological collection. Then, they engage in a hands-on activity, crafting their own miniature vases or figurines from clay, adorned with natural colours.</p>\n<p>“Form and shape in soil” is multidisciplinary in its approach. Students embark on a journey that integrates archaeology and art history, exploring the historical context and evolution of Cypriot ceramic art. Simultaneously, cultural anthropology is evident in this programme as children connect with the material culture of Cyprus, understanding how ceramics reflect ancient societies' daily lives. The use of natural stones for dyeing clay introduces a natural sciences component, offering insights into chemical processes. This blend of disciplines, including education, results in an enriching and comprehensive educational experience that goes beyond traditional disciplinary boundaries.</p>\n<p>In 2023, the BOCCF made significant and lasting changes, prioritising initiatives that increase accessibility to culture for all. The ‘Aisthiseis’ programme has been integrated into BOCCF’s core activities, emphasising a commitment to the value that everyone should have the opportunity to contribute to cultural production. ‘Aisthiseis’ aims to counter barriers faced by vulnerable groups, supporting a more inclusive and equitable society. Other examples of BOCCF initiatives include the instalment of permanent video-guided tours in the Cypriot sign language via QR codes, ensuring inclusivity for diverse audiences. Additionally, there are currently permanent audio-guided tours, accompanying replicas of artifacts from the BOCCF’s collections. The programme aims to reach beyond the architectural confines of the museum, with multisensory tours reaching areas outside the BOCCF and involving extensive training for staff and external individuals. By combining elements from cultural studies, linguistics, accessibility design, and education, the 'Aisthiseis' programme exemplifies a forward-thinking approach to cultural inclusion and education.</p>\n<p>One of the ‘Aisthiseis’ workshops is the “Walking Theatre” (for children and adults) which is an interactive walking tour that invites participants to immerse themselves in an unconventional theatrical experience within the confines of the Archaeological Museum at the BOCCF. The session begins with engaging games designed to foster camaraderie among participants. Then, drawing inspiration from the exhibits, collections, scents, and sounds within the museum, the participants engage in theatrical improvisations under the expert guidance an actress-theatrologist and an archaeologist. This multidisciplinary workshop combines expertise from two distinct fields – theatre and archaeology. The collaboration between an actress-theatrologist and an archaeologist brings together the creative and performative aspects of theatre with the historical and archaeological insights. Participants not only engage in theatrical activities but also gain a deeper understanding of the historical context and artifacts within the museum.</p>\n<p>The BOCCF also actively collaborates with diverse institutions to organise multidisciplinary workshops. These joint efforts involve partnerships with educational institutions, museums, and other cultural organisations. By combining expertise from various fields such as art, history, science, and technology, these workshops provide participants with a comprehensive and innovative learning experience. An example of a collaboration with a multidisciplinary approach is the collaboration between the Cyprus Institute and the BOCCF to offer the workshop titled “Mediterranean Diet: From the Neolithic period to today”. This workshop was held under the European programme “Foodprint: The Mediterranean Diet Revisited” which is a cross-media project explaining why the Mediterranean Diet is relevant to our lives. The workshop was specifically designed for children aged 8-12 and explored the origins and enduring essence of the Mediterranean Diet, spanning from the Neolithic era to the present day. Led by Archaeologists-Researchers from the Cyprus Institute, the workshop comprises three stations where children examine ancient seeds (Archaeobotany), animal bones (Zooarchaeology), and human bones (Bioarchaeology) commonly uncovered in archaeological excavations.</p>\n<p>“Mediterranean Diet: From the Neolithic period to today” integrates expertise from various archaeological disciplines and simultaneously allows participants to explore different aspects of the Mediterranean Diet, incorporating botanical, zoological, and human biological perspectives. Encouraging a broader exploration of topics, this workshop is multidisciplinary at its core.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, the BOCCF actively tries to incorporate various disciplines in its workshops, educational programmes, and through its collaborations with other organisations. This approach has been proven to be very effective for the participants’ learning experience, creativity, comprehensive understanding in various fields, as well as encouraging innovation and creativity as different disciplines bring unique perspectives and methodologies.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/1e1d9441-fdde-45b5-b823-05a40b914d0a/\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/d3ae1006-836d-48cb-aee4-988d8da7a69f/\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/18789c22-e292-4b41-a6d4-209846b5a7e6/\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/30812ef6-c716-4c14-a1ac-38c5a1b2681b/\" alt=\"\"></p>","excerpt":"The Bank of Cyprus Cultural Foundation’s multidisciplinary educational programmes and ‘Aisthiseis’ (Senses) workshops are designed to…","frontmatter":{"title":"Multidisciplinary workshops and educational programmes","pubstatus":"completed","date":"a month ago","target_audience":["PROFESSIONAL","VISITOR"],"pageId":"fa446663-8566-42a4-9c84-c8ab18338603","license":"CC BY 2.0","thumbnail":"https://ucarecdn.com/c4b804cd-477b-458f-8e3b-a3c6ca2830e6/","abstract":null,"challengesbestpractice":"BOCCF encounters some challenges in the implementation of its multidisciplinary initiatives.   Facing the challenges of attracting new audiences and maintaining relevance, the BOCCF recognises the imperative to continually revitalise its educational programmes and all its workshops in general. This involves a commitment to introducing captivating elements within the monthly schedule, ensuring that each instalment offers stimulating content. A key strategy involves tailoring workshops to appeal to diverse target groups, considering the unique needs and preferences of each audience. This customization is facilitated by a team of professionals, each possessing specialised expertise in specific areas, selected to contribute to the diversity of the cultural experiences offered. The BOCCF aims to create an inclusive environment that resonates with a broad spectrum of participants, addressing the evolving expectations and interests of both existing and potential audiences.   Another challenge that the BOCCF faces is maintaining financial sustainability which is crucial, particularly for targeted programmes, and securing funding for initiatives like 'Aisthiseis' workshops is vital for their continuity.   Additionally, the BOCCF needs to constantly adapt to the evolving educational landscape and technological advancements which require continuous assessment and integration of innovative methodologies while preserving the core values and aims of each workshop. For example, technology plays a key role in the ‘Aisthiseis’ workshops as it enables the creation of accessible content. Its integration not only expands the reach of cultural initiatives but also enhances the depth and impact of the educational experiences offered to diverse audiences.","desc":"The Bank of Cyprus Cultural Foundation embraces a multidisciplinary approach to its workshops and educational programmes, aspiring to provide a well-rounded experience to the participants that extends beyond conventional boundaries. Through thoughtfully curated programmes, ‘Aisthiseis’(Senses) workshops (a programme which aims to remove some of the barriers faced by vulnerable people for the benefit of us all and with a view to designing a better and fairer society) and collaborations with other institutions, one of the BOCCF’s main objectives is to offer a holistic educational journey for people of all ages. ","emailbestpractice":"katerina.patsalides@bankofcyprus.com","formtypbestpractice":"Audience and Local Community Engagement","infosbestpractice":"More about ‘Summer at the Museum 2023’:  In July 2023, the BOCCF decided to organise a two-week special summer learning experience for children aged 8-12 years old, titled ‘Summer at the Museum 2023’. This programme incorporated a multidisciplinary approach. Through engaging activities like archaeological digs, art projects, and interactive exercises, children cultivated critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and a profound appreciation for cultural heritage. The collaborative nature of the program, involving expert animators and peers, promoted teamwork and effective communication. Educational excursions in Nicosia provided real-world exposure, strengthening the children's connection to the subject matter.  An example of an educational programme that the children engaged in, was titled \"\"Invaluable: Currency and Other Treasures.\"\" Additionally, they participated in a novel component of the ‘Aisthiseis’ programme, experiencing the ‘Walking Theatre’ at the BOCCF’s Cyprus Mint History Museum. They looked into myths and fragments of Cypriot history inspired by the ancient coin collection. The expedition persisted as the children, guided by an actress-psychologist and an archaeologist, played games, drew inspiration, and crafted theatrical improvisations, offering them a unique theatrical encounter within the museum's confines.  Overall, BOCCF's multidisciplinary endeavors redefine cultural education, offering participants knowledge woven from diverse disciplines. From engaging educational programmes to collaborative workshops and partnerships, BOCCF's commitment to multidisciplinarity unfolds as a transformative force in the cultural landscape, enriching understanding and encouraging a dynamic and inclusive approach to learning.","keywordsbestpractice":"Accessibility, Inclusivity, multi-disciplinary","locationbestpractice":"Nicosia, Cyprus","orgbestpractice":"Bank of Cyprus Cultural Foundation","partnerbestpractice":"Bank of Cyprus Cultural Foundation","personsbestpractice":"Katerina Patsalidou","resourcesbestpractice":"The successful implementation of BOCCF's multidisciplinary educational programmes and workshops acquires various resources. These include hiring skilled educators/facilitators who are proficient in diverse fields such as archaeology, art, and theatre. Their expertise is essential for creating well-rounded and inclusive programmes.  Furthermore, the BOCCF has invested in technology to facilitate accessibility, such as creating video-guided tours in sign language. This includes acquiring cameras and recording equipment.  Financial resources are crucial for program development, outreach, and ensuring accessibility, particularly for initiatives targeting vulnerable populations. Lastly, ongoing support and collaboration from external institutions contribute to the sustainability and effectiveness of BOCCF's multifaceted endeavours.","successbestpractice":"Evaluating the effectiveness of the BOCCF's multidisciplinary workshops and educational programs involves assessing success through various means:  Feedback: Feedback for the BOCCF’s educational programmes and workshops consistently reflects participants' positive experiences. The BOCCF receives commendations for its inclusive and accessible approach, with participants expressing satisfaction in the design of workshops that cater to diverse needs. For example, for the BOCCF’s educational programmes, after each session, teachers receive an evaluation form. The form includes targeted questions such as \"\"Would you recommend this educational program to other schools?\"\" and \"\"How satisfied are you with the programme?\"\". The received feedback from these evaluation forms consistently reflects an excellent overall response. This feedback not only affirms the success of the BOCCF's educational initiatives but also serves as a valuable endorsement from educators, further solidifying the Foundation's reputation for delivering impactful and well-received educational programmes.  Participation rates: High participation rates in both 'Aisthiseis' workshops and educational programmes further validate the success of the BOCCF of this multidisciplinary practice. The consistently strong turnout signifies a broad appeal and resonance with the community. BOCCF has executed approximately 54 educational programmes for the year 2023, with each session having an attendance of 25 children. Additionally, in 2023, a total of 65 ‘Aisthiseis’ workshops were held. This robust participation is indicative of the Foundation's ability to attract and cater to new audiences. The widespread engagement underscores the inclusivity embedded in the design of the workshops and educational programmes, demonstrating the BOCCF's commitment to making cultural initiatives accessible to a broad spectrum of individuals.  Social Media and Online Presence: Another way of measuring success, is through the BOCCF’s social media posts about its workshops and educational programmes. The BOCCF is collaborating with an external marketing agency that aims for high engagement on social media posts. These engagement levels, including likes, shares, and comments on these posts, provide a reflection of the ongoing success and relevance these programmes. Furthermore, press releases are being sent to the media in Cyprus to inform and attract new audiences.    Collaboration and Partnerships: The success of the BOCCF’s multidisciplinary approach is evident through collaborations and partnerships with external institutions. These partnerships bring diverse expertise, innovative programming formats, and increased outreach to the BOCCF's cultural initiatives. By engaging with professionals from various fields, the foundation ensures a comprehensive approach to its educational programs, enhancing the richness of cultural experiences for a broader audience. Collaborations contribute to community integration, shared resources, and cross-disciplinary learning.    By employing a combination of these measurement strategies, the BOCCF gains an insight of the success of its multidisciplinary initiatives. Continuous assessment and a commitment to improvement are essential for ensuring ongoing success of highlighting the synergy of diverse expertise, aiming to transcend the limitations of a single disciplinary perspective.","timebestpractice":"Aisthiseis programme: January 2023 - Current date. Educational programmes 2018 - current date.","transferbestpractice":"The prospect of transferring BOCCF's diverse educational initiatives embodied in ‘Aisthiseis’ workshops to another cultural institution presents a valuable opportunity for knowledge exchange, broader societal influence and more accessibility to diverse groups. The transferability stems from the flexible and scalable nature of the programme, allowing for customization to meet the specific needs and cultural context of a different institution.  The success of BOCCF's initiatives in engaging youth with various fields demonstrates their universal appeal, making them adaptable to various educational settings. An example is the 'Form and shape in soil' programme which looks into ancient ceramic art and can easily be integrated into another institution's curriculum, providing students with a distinctive and enriching educational experience.  Furthermore, the potential transfer of 'Aisthiseis' workshops, aimed at breaking barriers for vulnerable populations, can be replicated in diverse cultural contexts. Such initiatives, when transferred, have the capacity to contribute to the creation of fairer societies globally by addressing the needs of marginalized communities, building informed spaces that are accessible to all.   Collaborations with external institutions further underscore the transferability potential. Successful partnerships between BOCCF and other organisations showcase the feasibility of establishing similar collaborations in new cultural environments. The recently concluded \"\"Summer at the Museum 2023\"\" stands as a testament to the success of such collaborative efforts, particularly evident in the partnership with the Cyprus Institute's STARC. The educational visit to STARC, where children explored Osteoarchaeology, Zoology, and Archaeobotany, exemplifies how fruitful collaborations can transcend traditional museum boundaries and introduce children to scientific disciplines.","urlsbestpractice":"https://www.boccf.org","theme":"Management","type":"bestpractice"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p>The St Paul's footsteps Cultural Route concept is based on similar religious and pilgrimage <a href=\"https://www.coe.int/en/web/cultural-routes\">Cultural Routes of the Council of Europe</a>, closely examined by the founding partners in the <a href=\"https://projects2014-2020.interregeurope.eu/cult-ring/\">Cult-RInG Interreg Europe</a> project during January 2017 - March 2021, such as the <a href=\"https://www.coe.int/en/web/cultural-routes/the-santiago-de-compostela-pilgrim-routes\">Santiago de Compostela Pilgrim Routes</a> in North Portugal, <a href=\"https://www.coe.int/en/web/cultural-routes/the-route-of-saint-olav-ways\">Route of Saint Olav Ways</a> in West Sweden, <a href=\"https://www.coe.int/en/web/cultural-routes/the-via-francigena\">Via Francigena i</a>n Lazio Region.

Cultural Routes of the Council of Europe have been established since 1987, stressing the importance of European identities. The Enlarged Partial Agreement (EPA) currently comprises 45 routes contributing to protection and development of natural and cultural heritage. Cultural Routes are used as powerful tools to promote and preserve EU’s shared and diverse cultural identities. Cultural Routes provide a better understanding of the history of Europe through interregional exchanges of people, ideas and cultures. They are a model for grassroots cultural co-operation, providing important lessons about identity and citizenship. Cultural Routes combine tangible and intangible heritage, illustrating and celebrating the exchanges, cultures and traditions that have shaped Europe over the millennia. Cultural Routes are instrumental in the European context, by promoting common European identity, deploying heritage and traversing borders for cultural tourism. In a very recent development (November 2021) the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) and the Council of Europe work together to develop the opportunities tourism offers to local communities and to enhance the tourist experience along the European region’s Cultural Routes. The joint actions are aimed at recognizing the added value that Cultural Routes offer for sustainable tourism development, cultural heritage safeguarding and intercultural dialogue.

The educational games related to the history and functions of money can be played by people of different educational backgrounds and intellectual abilities.</li>\n<li>Assistance is offered to visitors in each of the five parts of the exhibition.</li>\n<li>Competitive games provide a feeling of achievement.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Path of Money\r\nOur permanent exhibition is aimed to be a unique entertainment for the general public with opportunities for education about the history of money. The exhibition tells the compelling story of how money has emerged through the centuries and evolved up to its present state – with some glimpses of the future of money (green finances and digital national banks, crypto currencies) – by providing an innovative interactive gamification experience i.e., experiential knowledge transfer, for children and adults, in a state-of-the-art digital technology environment, considered most modern in Hungary, Europe and the rest of the world.\r\nThe central element of the visitor experience is a story in the form of a game that spans over the exhibition, and can be enjoyed by children and adults alike, where they can collect virtual hypothetical assets by solving quizzes and game situations.\r\nVisitors are part of the story, the proposed research, where they can experience for themselves why the milestones of the evolution of the economy (money, banking system, reserves, etc.) are so important.\r\nThe gamification experience ensures fun and knowledge transfer for the players, who can increase their virtual financial wealth as they go through the exhibition by using their acquired knowledge.\r\nThe feeling of achievement is an important feature of the virtual wealth accumulation game, which can encourage players to participate again and achieve better results.\r\nWithin the main story line, there are several finance related stories from Hungarian history presented in the relevant parts of the exhibition. One of the most riveting and hugely popular stories is the “Story of the Gold Train of the Central Bank of Hungary”, about which an animated film can be watched on a tabletop display.</p>\n<p>How technology is used to support the museum's work:\r\nThe operation of the Money Museum is based on technology. It provides visitors a unique experience through experiential knowledge transfer in the five nodes of the exhibition in an entertaining and engaging way. This magnetic tool not only attracts visitors, but they also stick around, inspired to come back for more “clicking”, which is undoubtedly a significant factor in increasing the number of visitors. Digital technology is also used in online booking, as well as the registration of the museum objects.</p>\n<p>Initiatives in the field of environmental and social sustainability:\r\nThe renovation of the museum building was completed last year, equipped with the most modern insulation and an efficient heating system.\r\nThe Money Museum takes responsibility for demonstrating its ecological attitude in all aspects of the building and its operation not merely to save energy, but also to promote sustainable methods that visitors might be able to follow. Our consciousness regarding energy manifests itself from keeping the temperature down at 18 degrees Celsius in winter, both in the exhibition and offices, through collecting waste selectively in the lobby and café, to the stools in Node III decorated with pieces of crushed (recycled) money withdrawn from circulation.\r\nTo reduce the use of paper we channel promotional material onto social media platforms and website as much as possible.

It hods collections of numerous artefacts dating from the Prehistoric era to the end of antiquity. They come from excavations conducted throughout Macedonia since 1912, along with handed-in antiquities. The museum is currently participating in many European research programs in order to elevate its digital presence taking advantage of technological developments and digital innovation. Although some of the projects are still ongoing, the results have shown that the Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki have upgraded its services to the public, offering an enjoyable and meaningful experience for every visitor. At the same time, these initiatives support the connection of the museum with the archaeological sites within the city of Thessaloniki and the broader area of central Macedonia. Finally, the use of digital technologies becomes a powerful tool for museum staff to manage their collection.\r\nThe Museum joins the project “CULTUREID: The Internet of Culture: RFID Technology in the Museum”. RFID tags installed in each of the exhibits of the Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki. This allows museum personnel and visitors to digitally interact with exhibits through appropriate RFID reading equipment. For the museum, it ensures the automatic recording of any interaction with the exhibits (maintenance, movement, interest-rate in the exhibition, etc.). Visitors are provided with a personalized tour at their mobile device (mobile, tablet), depending on their location, interests, and congestion in the Museum.\r\nThe museum also participates in the project “SignGuide: Automated Museum Guidance using Sign Language”. The goal of the SignGuide project is to develop a prototype interactive museum guide system for deaf visitors using mobile devices that will be able to receive visitors' questions in their native (sign language) with regard to the exhibits, and to provide additional content also in sign language using an avatar or video, utilizing techniques from the field of computer vision and machine learning. To this end, they will develop a demonstration system for guidance in the Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki. System integration and commercial exploitation will be done through MLS Information Technology.\r\nThe museums also launched a project entitled “e-HOE: Thessaloniki in the Age of Galerius: bringing a great period of the city's history to life, based on multidisciplinary research and state-of-the-art technologies”. Building on recent advances in 3D scanning and virtual reality technologies, the e-HOE project develops innovative tools for the diagnostics, conservation, documentation and showcase of monuments and objects of the Galerius Palace Complex, the most emblematic complex of ancient buildings in Thessaloniki, which includes monuments such as the Rotonda, the Arch of Galerious (Kamara) and the Hippodrome, as well as virtually connecting the Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki with the Palace Complex. The e-HOE tools provide the base for offering a novel multi-dimensional cultural experience highlighting two different dimensions, the historical/experiential one and the scientific/archaeological one, through cultural tours in the city. Museum visits and Complex tours enriched via augmented and virtual reality, thus, transferring the visitor in a \"vivid\" virtual past, where the buildings of the Palace Complex, objects from the Museum and citizens of the Galerius era involve in realistic everyday scenes of the past, offering valuable insights into the historical, social, economical and political reality of that era. In addition, the cultural tours highlight the scientific dimension of archaeology, focusing on the diagnostics, conservation and documentation of the Galerius Palace Complex and its excavation findings.\r\nThe Museum has also developed the application “Museum on the Go”, which is a digital tour guide of the Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki, that brings to life the history of the city and the larger area of central Macedonia. It is an entertaining game of search in time and space that brings us closer to the finds of the Archaeological Museum and the actual archaeological sites where they were once discovered.\r\nThe Museum also joins the project “Culture and Heritage for Responsible, Innovative and Sustainable Tourism Actions” (CHRISTA). The overall objective is to protect and preserve natural and cultural heritage assets and deploy them for the development and promotion of innovative, sustainable and responsible tourism strategies, including intangible and industrial heritage, through interpretation and digitisation, with capitalisation of good practices, policy learning, policy implementation and capacity building. Expected changes are in terms of improved policy instruments in destination regions, advances in relevant policy implementation, upgrading of cultural and natural assets and innovative applications.\r\nThis case is one of the most illustrative examples that show the multiple benefits for museums from the use of digital technologies. More specifically, it shows how technology can potentially facilitate collaborations between museums and heritage sites, support CH professionals to successfully manage their collections and provide visitors with an enjoyable and meaningful experience achieving educational purposes. It illustrates the importance of interacting with visitors in dynamic and powerful ways by offering transformative learning experiences, during the entire visitor's journey. Innovation and the use of technologies are at the heart of the museum's activity, helping it to make the transition from monologue to dialogue. This approach to CH is characterized by democratization, social inclusion and people centered approaches to cultural heritage. It makes CH accessible and more relevant to broader audiences, creates a sense of ‘playfulness’ and exploration and creates more accessible atmosphere for disabled persons.</p>","excerpt":"The Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki was built in 1962.

The story of the beginnings of significant tourism development in our city began in 2003, after the construction of Phase I of the Pannonian Lakes complex, although the roots of tourism in the city of Tuzla date back to 1914 when the first Salty Spa, known in Europe for treating various rheumatic diseases, was built.</p>\n<p>Salt, as a natural resource whose exploitation had been detrimental to the inner city core for years, thanks to the city administration led by the mayor of Tuzla, Mr. Jasmin Imamović, it has been utilized as an advantage for further successful urban development. This site used to be a marshy area without any content or purpose, and only 20 years later, it is a popular touristic site.</p>\n<p>For the purpose of urbanization and development of this large space in the city center, the city administration came up with the idea of utilizing the natural resource in the immediate vicinity of the complex – saline water, with the aim of constructing a water reservoir in the form of a salt lake with healing properties, functioning as a city open-air bathing area. In this way, the combination of a natural resource, human ideas, and human effort created the Pannonian Lakes complex as a top-notch ecological project unique in Southeastern Europe, a project that will serve for the benefit of all citizens of Tuzla, our region, and our country.</p>\n<p>After the realization of Phase I of the complex's development with the construction of the large (first) lake in July 2003, stage development continued in 2006 with the construction of the Archaeological Park – Neolithic Palafitte settlement with a museum exhibition that speaks to the continuity of life in the Tuzla area from the Neolithic era. At the beginning of the summer season in 2008, the capacities of the complex were significantly increased with the construction of the second salt lake, and by the end of September, another unique tourist product was created – Salty Waterfalls, in the form of an inhalation health center in the open air, unique to these areas. The third Pannonian lake was opened on September 1, 2012.</p>\n<p>The Pannonian Lakes complex, as the only salt lakes in Europe, has won numerous awards, with the most notable being the second prize in 2012 UNWTO ULYSSES AWARD, the highest recognition of the United Nations World Tourism Organization for innovations in public policies and management, for the project \"Valorization of Natural Heritage - Pannonian Salt Lakes in Tuzla,\" awarded for innovations in the field of tourism. In 2013, the city of Tuzla and the Pannonian Lakes received the International Tourism Award GOLDEN INTERSTAS 2013 for outstanding contribution to the development of tourism in the city of Tuzla and a significant contribution to the development of tourism in Bosnia and Herzegovina as a whole.</p>\n<p>The current work of the Pannonian Lakes complex in Tuzla provides optimistic forecasts for future development plans. The Pannonian Lakes complex covers a total area of 75,000 m², with a shoreline length of 1,000 m and a sandy beach area of 22,000 m². Since its construction in 2003, the complex has been visited by over 5.5 million guests to date. The reasons for the high visits to the Pannonian Lakes complex undoubtedly include the absolutely pure medicinal saltwater (beneficial for bone and respiratory diseases), guest stay standards, and complex maintenance higher than the Blue Flag standards for seas and lakes (especially in the segment of guest health and safety care), good entertainment and guest animation, and very low prices for all services at the complex.</p>\n<p>In the field of cultural tourism offerings, the Pannonica complex includes the Archaeological Park-Neolithic Palafitte settlement, a replica settlement from the Neolithic era with nine dwellings, a wooden platform, and an interior display of tools, utensils, and dishware for salt isolation. This setup testifies to the continuity of life in the Tuzla area for thousands of years. Additionally, the museum Geological Exhibition Pannonica showcases the spectacular geological history of the Tuzla area to guests.</p>\n<p>The uniqueness of the lakes lies in the water with which they are filled, representing a combination of technological water and high-concentration brine (300 mg/l). The proportion of saltwater in the total water volume is 30%, with a salinity of 30-35 gr/l., always at the level of seawater salinity. In addition to salinity, the water of the Pannonian lake contains minerals (calcium, sodium, sulfur, iodine, bromine, etc.) and has rightfully gained the image of \"medicinal\" water unique in our region and in Europe.\r\nThe complex is open throughout the year for visits, walks, and recreation for citizens. It includes a modern open-air fitness center, a Street Workout Park, a giant chessboard at the first lake, and mapped walking/jogging trails around the entire complex. Adjacent to the complex is the children's amusement park \"Saline Banja-Vrtić,\" equipped with entertainment and play facilities for children aged 3 to 12 years.</p>\n<p>Public Utility Company \"Pannonica\" is active even during the winter period. The first Ice Skating Rink in Tuzla and the Tuzla Canton was opened in collaboration with the city of Tuzla in December 2006. Within the complex is a covered ice rink with an area of 660 m², with a capacity for over 100 skaters per session.</p>\n<p>The development of this project has spurred a series of other tourist and cultural projects focused on developing additional offer in the city that meet the needs of numerous visitors and tourists. As a result, numerous festivals, entertainment and cultural programs, and events have been developed.

Later in the implementation of the project, the challenges were related to the technological aspects of the entire system at the lakes, which was also successfully ensured because special attention and care are taken in the maintenance (chemical and bacteriological) of the lake water through a specific technological process. The technological process involves 24-hour filtration of the total water volume of the lake (2.5 cycles) and its chemical treatment through a series of procedures such as maintaining pH levels, disinfection, algae destruction, flocculation (removal of water turbidity), and continuous physical cleaning of the lake complex. The most important segment of the technological process is water filtration, which is done through sand filters in two filter plants with 2.5 cycles in 24 hours for the total water volume. The process is automated with a constant supply of fresh technological water and brine. Disinfection of water, as the second most important process, is carried out with gaseous chlorine, and depending on weather conditions and the number of guests, the chlorine concentration is maintained at a level of 0.2-0.4 mg/l. All measurements and analyses of lake water (three times a week during the bathing season) are conducted at the Institute of Public Health of the Tuzla Canton, where all previous measurements have proven the absolute correctness and high quality of lake water during the bathing season.","desc":"Tuzla is a city that firmly decided to position tourism as one of the main drivers of further development, through concrete projects that have transformed the image of the city.

Thanks to visionary Mayor and cooperation and joint work of numerous experts committed to achieving success, any dream can be turned into reality.","urlsbestpractice":"https://panonika.ba/","theme":"Tourism","type":"bestpractice"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p>The 5 Senses Open-air Museum of Sciacca in Sicily (Italy) is a project aimed at creating a collaborative network engaging local communities and public administrations to make the historic city and its surroundings an unforgettable cultural tourism experience, relying on Sciacca’s uniqueness: people and the “beautiness” of the place where they live. During this period with millions of jobs at risk because of the pandemic crisis covid19, especially in the tourism sector, the 5 Senses Open-air Museum turns out to offer a governance model which can strongly help communities recover from the crisis both socially and economically, in a sustainable and responsible way. Small shops, craftsmen, accommodations, local products restaurants, institutions, work together in Sciacca to develop the territory and connecting it with buyers, consumers and influencers alike in the cultural heritage and tourism industries to generate value added markets centred on authentic cultural experience and local identity. This inclusive and bottom-up tourism innovation project has been implemented in only 2 years, generating a community network with more than 50 engagement agreements signed with all the trade categories, public institutions and volunteers’ associations, over 18 “care of hospitality” specifications signed with the accommodations, as many bar, restaurants, craftsman involved and over 50 experiences ready for tourists.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/831f1334-f215-425f-b504-d8a4fc6d4850/\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>A big community engaged to build its future. This is done through an innovative, inclusive and responsible GOVERNANCE that:</p>\n<p>- manages the process transforming local good and services into tourist products;</p>\n<p>- ensures quality;</p>\n<p>- provides a constant monitoring of impacts with the necessary measures whenever necessary;</p>\n<p>- generates better income opportunities for ALL.</p>\n<p>Moreover, since people and identities (meaning the historical/artistic/cultural heritage of the area where they live) are ready-to-be-valorised resources in whatever country/region/territory, the project offers an innovative and replicable method ready to scale-up and to be implemented everywhere in Europe and internationally. The 5 Senses Open-air Museum of Sciacca was selected in 2021 as a best practice within the Community of Innovators in circular and human-centred cultural tourism within the Horizon 2020 Be.CULTOUR project (<a href=\"http://www.becultour.eu\">www.becultour.eu</a>). The project implementation is led by the Community Cooperative “Identity and Beauty”, which includes all actors interested to enhance the “hidden treasures” of Sciacca placing people, beauty and cultural identity / heritage at the centre of the development strategy. The approach adopted in Sciacca became rapidly known and turned an abandoned and underused cultural heritage area into a place of new attractiveness, vibrancy, and culturally interesting area for both visitors and residents, generating new jobs, learning and training opportunities for all, and especially regenerating trust and hope (in a period of dramatic crisis, globally).</p>\n<p>The Method implemented is a 3-phase process which guides communities from awareness to quality product and services’ delivery for tourism based on their territory identity and beauty:</p>\n<p>• AWARENESS of the heritage available but not yet enhanced;</p>\n<p>• COMPETENCE in transforming resources into social, cultural, environmental, economic, human value;</p>\n<p>• CONNECTIONS in the territories, so essential today, to create synergies for a development that will last over time Our Vision is a community engaged in a sustainable and responsible development of its territory. An engaged-community is able to guarantee viable long-term economic operations, providing socioeconomic benefits to all stakeholders that are fairly distributed, including stable employment and income-earning opportunities, and contributing to equality and poverty alleviation.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/cc35105a-157b-4ff0-8539-fc7009c5a124/\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Our Mission is to guide communities to move from a condition of fragmentation and limited integration between supply and demand in tourist and cultural services to a cooperative, participated and inclusive network ecosystem. The overall outcome is that the whole community grows and develops in a horizontal, sustainable, responsible, and circular way.</p>\n<p>HORIZONTAL ECONOMY: inside the 5 Senses Open-air Museum, with a horizontal structure, the stakeholders are the whole community, the governance is the expression of the engaged residents, investments are shared and the revenues immediately distributed among all the community individuals.</p>\n<p>CIRCULAR ECONOMY: inside the 5 Senses Open-air Museum the economy is “circular” because the project creates a skilled-people network who take, transform and reuse resources from the area where they live into tourist products without waste.</p>\n<p>RESPONSIBLE TOURISM: The strong networking the 5 Senses Open-air Museum in based on is the best guarantee of responsible tourism. This is because the impact on local populations, on the social system and on the identity balance is not influenced by external elements but by the engaged community.</p>\n<p>SUSTAINABLE TOURISM: the whole structure of the 5 Senses Open-air Museum is genetically built on sustainability at three levels.</p>\n<p>A) Respect for the environment as a fundamental strategic resource that must last over time.</p>\n<p>B) Controlled use of the land’s products by respectful tourism</p>\n<p>C) Ethics and profit are no longer in conflict and we can combine humans and nature’s needs in a harmonious way, guaranteeing long-term economic sustainability for the whole community.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/8053fed8-c28a-4960-9547-8ef26708024d/\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The project innovative part is both about process and tools. From a process point of view, the project aims to foster a successful tourism innovation and entrepreneurial ecosystem by connecting all stakeholders, the “engaged community”, to collaboration opportunities and prioritizing capacity building in tourism and cultural services. In order to achieve this strategic target, we have developed: - an innovative Governance Model for the actions and resource management and control; templates and disciplinary agreements to help the community be engaged and get higher quality standards; - an innovative tool called the Identity Business Model Canvas (IBMC) to facilitate the collaborative action among the different categories and to enable the creation of a Business Model whose stakeholders are not the members of a single company but the citizens of an entire community and which Core Business is the Storytelling of the historical/artistic/cultural heritage of the area.</p>\n<p>T﻿his museum won the 1st prize in the 2022 ECTN Awards, also in the framework of ReInHerit Horizon 2020 CSA, with Europa Nostra and European Travel Commission.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/c97025bf-9673-4e8a-8a34-3e4d60325097/\" alt=\"\" title=\"This project received the 1st prize in the ECTN Awards &#x27;Destination of Sustainable Cultural Tourism 2019&#x27;, in the category &#x27;Cooperation between museums and heritage sites&#x27;, by a joint jury with Europa Nostra and European Travel Commission also in the framework of ReInHerit 2020 CSA.\"></p>","excerpt":"The 5 Senses Open-air Museum of Sciacca in Sicily (Italy) is a project aimed at creating a collaborative network engaging local communities…","frontmatter":{"title":"The 5 Senses Open-air Museum of Sciacca, Sicily","pubstatus":"completed","date":"a month ago","target_audience":["PROFESSIONAL","VISITOR"],"pageId":"337f29df-fd94-4edb-b7ca-893509b38759","license":"CC BY 2.0","thumbnail":"https://ucarecdn.com/36850578-c993-48ee-824b-0b3d7a0cbd55/","abstract":null,"challengesbestpractice":"Environmental impact: environmental protection has also become a development strategy.

The aim was to use technology to bring Dublin's old stories to life in a new way. The core idea was to help drive visitors to less frequented areas of the city and encourage the development of new experiences thought out Dublin.</p>\n<p>The Idea:\r\nDuring Covid 19 we noticed that many people became accustomed and used to exploring and researching destinations via their smart phone. We decided to use this emerging trend as an opportunity to help visitors explore the city in a new and digital way. We knew that Dublin was full of stories, history, heritage and culture and that we needed to come up with a way to unlock that information and put it into the hands of visitors. Ultimately the core idea of the App was to help direct visitors, both local, domestic and international to lesser visited parts of Dublin city in a way that was exemplary of the cutting edge of digital experience development.</p>\n<p>The concept:\r\nAt the time (2019) mobile apps we not very popular or available for the purposes of story telling. We decided to explore the area of Digital Tour guiding and Digital Trails more. To do this we consulted with many other destinations which had already developed such Apps, such as Linz, London and Derry. However many of these applications did not go as far as we wanted in creating an outstanding digital experience. We knew that we needed something more advanced. Having decided on core requirements we decided to consult the market for our solution in 2020.</p>\n<p>Creating efficiencies and scale through a framework approach:\r\nHaving spoken to colleagues in other destinations we knew that one of the core challenges for these kinds of projects was in creating efficiencies and scale. We knew that many destinations were developing many Apps at the same time and that the market was getting crowded and confusing from the perspective of the visitor. That is why we did something very unique in terms of procurement of this digital service. In order to stop the development of many similar apps with small budgets spread out amongst many diverse stakeholders we decided to create a centralisted heritage trail platform for Dublin. This meant that we would procure these services together as a group of clients rather than separate entities. This would mean that we could centralise our resources and content onto one app and focus our budget and promotion directly in one place. This multi-client approach to digital heritage product development is something that was very unique to Dublin at the time. This meant that we could now build one platform that would tell the story of Dublins unique heritage and history and the platform would be shared between the major city partners of Dublin.</p>\n<p>The Market Solution:\r\nIn 2020 we put out a PIN or Prior Indicative Notice to consult the market on Digital Heritage Trails solutions. Having received many submission from developers we decided to proceed with an EU tender to acquire the service directly. In 2021 we published the EU Tender for Digital  Heritage Trail App design services at a total contract value of €500,000. At the time this was the largest of its kind Digital Heritage Trail app project.</p>\n<p>Doors Into Docklands Trail Development.<br>\nIn 2021 we appointed the developer Peel X to develop our new Digital Trails Platform called Dublin Discovery Trails. Along with Peel and a dedicated project development team we began work on the first trail which would be Doors into Docklands a new immersive trail which would tell the unique history and heritage of Dublins Docklands thought immersive technology and Augmented Reality. The working group was made up of representatives from across the city as well as historians and city mangers.</p>\n<p>Content Development:\r\nIn Dublin we know that we have an incredible rich history. In order to bring that history to life we needed excellent content for the Doors Into Docklands Trail. We deiced to use a first of its kind AR Portal development which would allow the user to experience the past as a 360 degree portal. We identified four heritage hero points which would be appropriate for this new AR technology. These included, the recreation of the Crimean Banquet in the CHQ building. The animation of the famine memorial statues on the quay. The recreation of heritage Guinness barges sailing up the Liffey river and the famous burning of the Custom House in 1921. Much of this content and archival material was crowd sourced from historians, museums, partners, attractions and local historians and community groups within the area itself.</p>\n<p>Testing and Launch:\r\nAs we neared the launch of the App we tested it amongst several diverse stakeholder groups in the city including internally with city stakeholders and externally with local history groups and citizens. Finally, after much successful testing we launched the app on the 11th of January 2023 in the CHQ Building in Dublin City Centre. Since its launch the App has been very successful with over 4k downloads with an average user time of 30 minutes. This means that there is now more visitors exploring more diverse and under visited areas of the city than ever before. The launch of the app has also been a huge success in terms of the network it has created. Since the launch of the Doors into Docklands Trail there has been three additional trails in other parts of Dublin added to the App with two more planned for late 2023. For us in Dublin this demonstrates a great example of how a city can come together to create best in class immersive digital heritage experiences.</p>\n<p>Review and Learnings:\r\nDuring the development of Dublin Discovery Trails we launched the first ever Digital Trails Toolkit (attached), so that others could learn from our experience.</p>\n<p>\n        <div class=\"embedVideo-container\">\n            <iframe\n              title=\"\"\n              width=\"560\"\n              height=\"316\"\n              src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ssTZ6cqjT0Y?rel=0\"\n              class=\"embedVideo-iframe\"\n              style=\"border:0\"\n              \n              loading=\"eager\"\n              allowfullscreen\n\t      sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups\"\n            ></iframe>\n        </div></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/52f7f9aa-a2e1-4942-9eea-c29ea0a46d66/\" alt=\"\" title=\"This project received the 2nd prize in the ECTN Awards &#x27;Destination of Sustainable Cultural Tourism 2023&#x27;, in the category &#x27;Digitalisation advances and digital transition in Sustainable Cultural Tourism&#x27;, by a joint jury with Europa Nostra and European Travel Commission also in the framework of ReInHerit Horizon 2020 CSA.\"></p>","excerpt":"The Aim:\r\nIn 2019 Dublin City decided to invest in a new and unique story telling App for the city.

The BremerhavenGuide offers an interactive, digital city map in which various themed tours can be started, such as the historical tour \"Experience a journey through time in Bremerhaven\". The digital tour of the city's history takes you to interesting sights and historical locations. From the oldest active lighthouse on the German North Sea coast to the Historical Museum, the Emigration Monument and the historic bascule bridge. The app uses videos, audio stories, images and texts to provide entertaining information at a total of 20 stations.  At some \"Points of Interest\" (PoI), a very special information experience awaits the user. Whenever the word \"Augmented Reality\" (AR) is displayed on a PoI page, you can use your smartphone to explore unexpected insights, entertaining visualisations or exciting all-round views. AR technology offers users an enhanced city experience by merging the real environment with virtual elements. Virtual reality glasses are not required for the interactive city experience. The user only needs an AR-capable smartphone or tablet to play the AR scenes. The interactive experiences, which conventional sources of information cannot reproduce, evoke positive emotional reactions in the viewer (wow effect), which also contribute to an improved perception of the historical sites and cultural assets. The innovative storytelling, such as fascinating 360-degree views and the integration of numerous playful elements and activities, motivates users even more to engage with the city's historical sites and sights and also creates positive experiences.</p>\n<p>The BremerhavenGuide is innovative from a technical and conceptual point of view and was designed as a virtual interface to the city society and local tourists and all interested parties as a tourism and city marketing tool.

The clear and well-organised architecture of the app ensures a high level of user quality. In order to fulfil the different requirements of the users, the APP can be set to either English or German. The text size can also be customised. Frequently asked questions are answered under the \"Info\" tab and allow feedback to be sent.</p>\n<p>The BremerhavenGuide was developed under the premise of sustainability. The dimension of social sustainability was taken into account in several respects. On the one hand, the cultural assets relevant to Bremerhaven, such as the historic bascule bridge at the New Harbour, the Simon-Loschen lighthouses and the rear light in the Fishery Harbour showcase and the converted historic fish station in the Fishery Harbour showcase, are presented in detail in the app. The city's cultural heritage is brought to life for visitors through innovative storytelling and promotes regional identity.\r\nThe fascinating 360-degree views and AR elements make it possible to experience places such as historic ships that are difficult to make accessible to people with physical disabilities.\r\nAR technology also makes it possible to experience historical sites and sights that are not open to the public, offering users unique experiences. Among other things, the BremerhavenGuide enables a spectacular view from the Oberfeuer lighthouse, which is otherwise only accessible to the relevant personnel. The implementation of wind noises makes the scene even more authentic for the viewer.</p>\n<p>With the BremerhavenGuide, the city of Bremerhaven wants to generate a wide reach and visibility for the historical and touristically relevant PoI in Bremerhaven. The BremerhavenGuide is also intended to attract new target groups such as young people with an affinity for mobile phones. The APP is intended to draw the attention of the city's society, tourists and interested parties to the tourism-related institutions of knowledge transfer, such as the German Maritime Museum - Leibnitz Institute of Maritime History and the German Emigration Centre, so that the exciting and informative offers of these institutions are used even more. To this end, the APP was designed in such a way that the respective digital tour can be interrupted at any time and the user can decide on the city experience themselves. The personalised use of the APP meets the user's need for individuality and enables the use of further information services on site at any time. To help users find their way around the city, their own location and the routes to the PoI locations are displayed on the city map. The app thus helps to make the historical and cultural sites that can be found throughout the city more visible to the user.</p>\n<p>The content of the APP is created and managed via a content management system, which is located at Erlebnis Bremerhaven. As the tourism company (Erlebnis Bremerhaven) has direct access to the content of the APP, the BremerhavenGuide can be maintained and expanded by its own employees. The content does not become outdated and there is a sufficient degree of flexibility in the management of the BremerhavenGuide. An IT service provider only needs to be utilised for the development of AR scenes. The technical feasibility of the app is regularly monitored and adapted to the technical development of smartphone technology.</p>\n<p>The presentation of the historical and cultural sites by the BremerhavenGuide provides digital rather than physical information.

A joint workshop was held with the client (Erlebnis Bremerhaven) and the commissioned IT agency to complete this task, taking into account the technical feasibility. Together, key elements of the application such as the cloud database, CMS system, interactive elements and app-compliant operating concept as well as intuitive use were defined.   During the implementation of the new design and functional concept, however, sources of error arose that could not have been foreseen during the conceptualisation phase. An error management system was integrated so that these sources of error could be identified quickly and the application could be improved and optimised accordingly.  Creating complete accessibility for the app is currently an unresolved challenge, as screen reader and keyboard use is not possible in the app. Solution structures are currently being developed and will be implemented in the near future.  A further challenge was compliance with the legal framework provided by the General Data Protection Regulation. The application could only be implemented under the premise of compliance with the regulation. In addition to the technical and legal challenges, the development of the app also raised the question of the acceptance of AR technology. How will the technology be accepted in the newly developed app? What reservations exist regarding the communication of information through the use of AR technology? To answer these questions, the questions were examined as part of a master's thesis at Bremerhaven University of Applied Sciences in the \"Digitalisation, Innovation and Information Management\" course. The findings and recommendations derived from the master's thesis were taken into account in the further development of the APP.","desc":"The \"BremerhavenGuide\" is a free app that brings the maritime cultural heritage of the city of Bremerhaven to life in an innovative and emotional way.

For this reason, Bornholm has been nicknamed “The Sunny Island”. Destination Bornholm ApS has been working with local partners in the tourism industry, municipality, and other public and private entities to build a sustainable tourism destination since 1992. Through the years, both the Spring and Autumn months have seen a steady increase in visitors and helped prolong the season, benefiting the island through economic and social stability and growth.</p>\n<p>Turning a summer destination into a Winter Island In 2019 Destination Bornholm started a new project in cooperation with several local partners Danish Board of Business Development with the lofty goal of turning our island into a winter travel destination. The goal was to expand the tourism season into the winter months, thus creating opportunities to increase revenue for local businesses, create more full-time employment within the tourism industry and offer the island community a wider range of activities during the winter. We also realized that Bornholm is a very different destination compared to the summer months during the winter period. During the summer, every store, attraction, and shop is open and can cater to our guests, but most businesses hibernate until spring during winter. The closed businesses also limit the opportunities for the local inhabitants to experience their own island.</p>\n<p>Open for business</p>\n<p>However, several businesses are open during the winter season, and the project partners agreed to keep their doors open during winter. So even though there might be several closed doors, plenty of shops, eateries, attractions, and accommodations were now open. Enough to create a unique travel experience to Bornholm for any tourist during the winter period. For the benefit of the tourists AND the locals To help tourists find open local businesses (and promote those who were open), Destination Bornholm initiated a digital development project, partly funded by Danish Board of Business Development. The aim was to upgrade our local destination travel guide app, ‘Bornholm’, so the visiting tourist were given a tool that helped them navigate Winter Island Bornholm. As a side effect the locals started using the app to find open restaurants, shops, events.</p>\n<p>During 2019-2020 Destination Bornholm launched a three-stage digital development project to facilitate a smarter and more accessible travel destination.</p>\n<p>The development stages were:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Event Engine: Creating a unique overview of events on the island by creating an “Event Engine” that could automatically fetch event data from local partners and display them in Destination Bornholm’s app and on the website <a href=\"http://www.bornholm.info\">www.bornholm.info</a>. This helped promote events during the winter period and optimized the time used for the event creators since they only had to create their event once (in their own system). Several local attractions implemented this Event Engine – incl. Bornholm’s Museum and Bornholm’s Art Museum.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Usability upgrade: Destination Bornholm has allowed our partners to update their information directly on the destination website and official travel guide app in a unique cooperation between a local destination agency and local businesses. The partners have a login and can edit their opening hours, images, contact information and create events directly in Destination Bornholms database. This procedure was initially developed in 2017 but optimized through a usability upgrade during this project. The upgrade makes it easier for businesses, locals, and event creators to access the system and promote their offers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Inspiration in the official app: To guide tourists to great travel experiences, the official travel guide app ‘Bornholm’ was upgraded to include inspiration articles that could highlight experiences available during their stay on the island. Through this new system Destination Bornholm can now display selected articles from the app in both Danish, German and English – such as “Sjove vinteraktiviteter for familier med små børn” (Danish for “Fun winter activities for families with small children”).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/aa1ccd1a-f18e-4952-a913-aea975fcea70/\" alt=\"\" title=\"Certificate of ETCN Awards 2022 1st Prize in the category &#x27;Digitalisation in Sustainable Cultural Tourism, towards Smart Destinations&#x27;, in the framework of ReInHerit Horizon 2020 CSA, by joint jury Europa Nostra and European Travel Commission.\"></p>\n</li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"Bornholm is known as the “Sunshine Island” Historically, the Danish Island of Bornholm has always been known as a summer destination.

An  unforeseen development in the project affected the key performance indicators. However, during 2019 and 2020, Destination Bornholm implemented the digital development described in the  previous sections and continued to lobby local businesses and partners to stay open during the winter.  As part of the ‘Event Engine’ digital development the following partners were automatically integrated into  Bornholm’s official travel guides in the app ‘Bornholm’ and on the website www.bornholm.info: Bornholm’s Museum (incl. all subdepartments) Svanekegården Grønbechs Gård Bornholm’s Teater Gaarden – Bornholm’s Food Culture House NaturBornholm Bornholm’s Art Tour Bornholm’s Culture Week It is estimated that these partners and others have contributed with several hundred new events through the  Event Engine and thanks to the usability upgrade. Dialogue with the newly established ‘Bornholm’s Christmas Market’ also helped create a strong reason-to-go.  The pandemic hit Europe hard in 2020 and 2021and, closed borders and quarantine laws prevented international  travel to Bornholm. Especially the number of international tourists to Bornholm. In the winter months of 2020,  Bornholm lost over 90% of its international accommodation bookings compared to the previous year.  More open local businesses Luckily, Bornholm managed to attract Danes during the summer and Autumn to offset the lack of German,  Swedish, Polish, and other international tourists. The island’s popularity helped Destination Bornholm and our  partners persuade local businesses to keep their doors open during the winter. At the project's start, there were  208 registered open businesses on the island during winter, but in 2021 that number had increased to 375.  Destination Bornholm could present tourists and locals with the best overview of everything Winter Island  Bornholm had to offer through digital platforms. More Guests and more revenues As the travel restrictions were still in effect during the winter of 2020 and (to some degree) 2021, Bornholm  became a popular winter destination for Danes. In 2020 Bornholm experienced a 29% increase in Danish  overnight stays. In the winter of 2021, this number increased by 144% and helped Bornholm’s tourism industry  through the pandemic. We estimate that during the winter months of 2020 and 2021, Bornholm’s tourism  revenue increased from an estimated 47 Mio. DKK to almost 72 Mio. DKK – a 53% increase in times of a  pandemic. We believe this success was achieved based on this project’s goals of developing an innovative digital travel  destination that helped facilitate co-operation between local businesses, the local community, and tourists.

At the same time, such opportunities promote dialogue between the museum and its local and global community. To reach a wider and international audience, this Best Practice was delivered in English. Registration was free. It focused on somatic symptom disorders (SSDs) that occurred in young women passing from puberty to sexual maturity in Ancient Greece and fin de siècle (late 19th century) Europe. It also examined adult women’s somatic disorders as a reaction to rethinking their roles as wives or mothers.</p>\n<p>• A workshop with teenagers with the title “Identities” delivered by the Civil Non-Profit Company Cinemathesis. The workshop was completed in four sessions which spanned over two months. Through the use of photography, cinematography, photocollage, self-portrait, the analysis of visual and audio material, books, archives and personal references and iconic films of international cinema, the participants had the opportunity to approach the topic of gender identity, building a digital archive of their artworks which will be in dialogue with the “ReThinking Identities” exhibition. At the end of the workshop, a short film narrating the whole experience was created. It is suggested that a small group of participants is selected for this workshop.

The Museum of Cycladic Art transferred all its activities to an online format and delivered them through Zoom, including workshops and art talks. Following the end of the pandemic and the relaunch of all museum activities, while the hybrid format is still available for certain events such as art talks, there is one activity, which is still offered online and is called “Zoom in Schools”. More specifically, the museum offers virtual tours through zoom for schools located in remote places such as remote island schools with a limited number of pupils who cannot travel to the museum.

More specifically, the mobile showcase is a mobile unit with drawers containing copies of artifacts, tactile maps and other materials. These enable visitors with sensory disabilities (visual and auditory impairments) to experience the exhibits for the first time. Accompanied by trained museum staff, two or more individuals at a time will be able to follow a thematic route, taking them on a multisensory tour of Early Cycladic art and culture. Moreover, a floor plan of the exhibition space, tactile maps of Greece and the Cyclades, and real-size copies of exhibits and figurines made of marble or resin are also included. Apart from texts in Braille for the visually impaired, there are texts in large print available for visitors with partial vision, as well as an audio tour of the Collection of Cycladic Art, available in both Greek and English.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<!--\\[if !supportLists]-->2.       <!--\\[endif]-->Multi-sensory museum kit related to Cycladic Culture, featuring the marble figurines of the Cycladic collection of the museum and the associated geographical/historical background.\n<p>The museum kit is created to take Cycladic culture also outside the museum.

The main aim of these channels is to inform ReInHerit’s audiences on all project activities and events and engage so various audiences can be more involved in the project activities. At the same time, it aims at sharing knowledge and results which specifically target cultural heritage professionals and direct them to seek knowledge in the digital hub of the project or learn from the useful resources included in our YouTube channel.</p>\n<p>Before drafting the social media strategy, the social media leader defined the audience engagement needs of the project which would determine the social media strategy to be followed. Social media engagement can be considered as a measure of all interactions with our social media content. Higher audience engagement can be a measure of good quality content which leads to greater reach for our social media channels. The most popular types of engagement are likes, comments and shares.</p>\n<p>Other important social media metrics are the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Shares or retweets</li>\n<li>Followers and audience growth</li>\n<li>Mentions</li>\n<li>Use of our pages’ dedicated hashtags</li>\n<li>Click-throughs</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Following that and taking into account the target audiences, key messages and mission of the project, the social media strategy was drafted and shared with all partners of the project. As the social media pages of an EU-funded project need to equally reflect the activities of all participating partners, the social media strategy needs to be communicated to all partners and be clear to all of them. Each partner is expected to equally contribute with content regarding their activities.</p>\n<p>By using customized content specially created for the needs of each platform, ReInHerit’s audience has a digital experience that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Showcases the programme’s work and activities.</li>\n<li>Offers easy access to information and updates (webinars, digital exhibition, press conferences, hackathon etc.)</li>\n<li>Generates awareness about the efforts of ReInHerit.</li>\n<li>Develops the interest of the audience about the project’s key – messages: sustainability, innovation, co-creation and relevance</li>\n<li>Entices younger audiences who are interested in cultural heritage to explore deeper info about the programme and its goals.</li>\n<li>Inspires.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>To achieve this, the approach adopted is:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>audience-centered and insight-driven</li>\n<li>constantly evaluated and enhanced</li>\n<li>distributed across multiple platforms</li>\n<li>open and sharable</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The target audience of the social media of the project was in line with the project proposal and in line with the objectives of the project. ReInHerit’s communication and dissemination strategy aimed at helping the audience engage with European cultural heritage from different access points. Social media was considered as key for the consortium to reach the desired audiences through the social media platforms.</p>\n<p>To make the social media strategy more effective, a common tone of voice was established which could make the project distinguishable. At the same, content was updated constantly with extensive promotion taking place before, during and after an important activity or event took place in close collaboration with the partners leading each activity.</p>\n<p>The social media accounts of the partner organisations or partner organisations’ representatives also acted as multipliers of the project. All partners were involved in content creation as they informed the social media manager of their activities which were newsworthy and sent texts and visual content. This content was edited by the social media manager for different social media platforms and published.</p>\n<p><strong>The three axes of the social media strategy</strong></p>\n<p>More specifically,</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a particular strategy about posts.

The Association seeks to support\r\nthe research, educational, exhibition, cultural and publishing activities of the Museum in\r\norder to promote the ancient, Byzantine and modern cultural heritage of Volos and the\r\nProvince of Magnesia in order to sensitize the visitors of the region to history and art.\r\nThe Athanassakeio Archaeological Museum of Volos was built in 1909 and was donated to\r\nthe Greek State by Alexios Athanassakis, a benefactor from Mt. Pelion, in order to exhibit\r\nthe painted funerary stelae of ancient Demetrias found in re-use as a building material in\r\nthe city’s wall towers. In 2004 the Museum was renovated. The exhibition of the old wing\r\nwas renewed and expanded to a new wing as an additional exhibiting space, which was\r\ninaugurated in 2009. The Museum’s galleries display finds from archaeological excavations\r\nin Thessaly since the beginning of the 20th century. The archaeological collections are\r\nrepresented thematically according to contemporary museological perceptions and\r\npractices.\r\nThe Association has been very active during the European Year of Cultural Heritage 2018\r\n(EYCH2018) aiming to contribute to the initiative on ‘Tourism and heritage: promoting\r\nsustainable cultural tourism’ by involving the local host community to inform visitors. A\r\nPanhellenic Conference was held in Volos, dedicated to EYCH2018, with the participation\r\nof all the Friends of the Museums, entitled \"Friends of the Museums in Modern Museum</p>\n<p>Practice, Modernity and Reflections in the European and International Space\" co-\r\norganized with the Hellenic Federation of Friends of Museums and the, at the proposal of</p>\n<p>the Association. This conference was held under the auspices of the Ministry of Culture and\r\nSport and the Region of Thessaly and took place on 5, 6 and 7 October 2018 at Valis Hotel\r\nin Agria, Volos.\r\nThe conference was attended by the honorable metropolitan of Dimitriados, the Regional\r\nGovernor of Thessaly, deputies of the prefecture and mayors and municipal councilors\r\nrepresentatives of cultural and tourism organizations, the President of the Hellenic\r\nAssociation of Friends of Museum Associations, vice president of ICOM, and a host of\r\nworld-wide friends, simple people who love culture and teachers of our local society.\r\nFriends of the Museums from 48 museums in Greece, were among them. The purpose of\r\nthe Conference was to provide two-way communication between civil society, museums\r\nand cultural operators in general.\r\nThe acquaintance and the relations of the Associations, Unions, Associations, Friends of the\r\nMuseums, the exchange of opinions, suggestions and good practices, as well as their\r\napplicability, within the new spirit of modernity that appears in the Museum of the Future.\r\nMuseum friends listen to the modern trends and demands, through the synergies with the\r\n\"World Federation of Friends of the Museums\" so as to be able to assist, in the new\r\ncircumstances and the new role, Museums in their relations with the general public and the\r\nnewly formed society.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the Conference was an excellent opportunity for all Friends of Museums\r\nto join a cultural and entertainment visit of the local archeological and cultural wealth the Neolithic Settlements of Diminio and Sesklo, the Ancient Theater and the Palace of Ancient\r\nDemetrias.</p>\n<p>The aim of the conference was to highlight synergies of culture and tourism, to be a very\r\nsubstantial, successful and creative meeting of civil society for culture, the excellent\r\ninstitution of Friends of the Museums. Our cultural assets must be fully exploited even in the\r\ncrisis. It is our duty to preserve, save and disseminate our cultural heritage to the new\r\ngenerations. Our culture could at the same time be a very powerful economic factor for\r\nour country. In any case, it takes hard work, organization, projection, and proper training.\r\nEducation is the basis of all. Each of us therefore has to \"fight\" separately through each\r\nbody (public, private, club, cultural association, etc.) so that cultural wealth can be saved\r\nand exploited in the best way - and for the benefit of society and our economy.</p>\n<p>The invaluable treasures of our cultural heritage are also associated with the much-\r\nneeded development of our country and region, as our rich cultural reserve could be a</p>\n<p>very powerful economic factor. Our culture can be linked to Tourism, promoting it, and at\r\nthe same time giving it a particular qualitative dimension. On the other hand, tourism can\r\nbecome one of the most powerful tools for the dissemination and promotion of the rich and\r\nworld-class cultural heritage. Today's challenge is to find ways to consolidate the positive\r\nachievements, positive messages and to \"communicate\" our own unique identity abroad\r\nin a single and clear way to ensure in the long run a new position of our country in an\r\ninternational map, the complex web of international perceptions and stereotypes. The\r\nultimate recipients of the promotion of our cultural heritage are the local community itself,\r\nwe are all civil society for this reason and our sympathy is crucial to the success of our\r\ngoals.\r\nThat is why the conference was open to all citizens, members of the unions, students,\r\nteachers and all those who loved and wished to experience culture heritage.\r\nIt is certain that we will have a lot to benefit from, offer to our Museums but mainly to get to\r\nknow the Museums and the rich European cultural reserve of our homeland and, above\r\nall, the synergy of citizens and actors. We will be calling on relevant actors from different\r\ncountries to participate, since we all have to get to know Europe's cultural heritage.\r\nThe conference decided to set up a network of Museums of Magnesia and Thessaly with\r\nthe aim of increasing the awareness of cultural goods, jointly taking initiatives and actions\r\nand jointly organizing events for the cultural development and culture of civil society\r\nthrough the acquaintance with our cultural heritage.</p>\n<p>\n        <div class=\"embedVideo-container\">\n            <iframe\n              title=\"\"\n              width=\"560\"\n              height=\"316\"\n              src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nXBVvce4HKQ?rel=0\"\n              class=\"embedVideo-iframe\"\n              style=\"border:0\"\n              \n              loading=\"eager\"\n              allowfullscreen\n\t      sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups\"\n            ></iframe>\n        </div></p>\n<p>\n        <div class=\"embedVideo-container\">\n            <iframe\n              title=\"\"\n              width=\"560\"\n              height=\"316\"\n              src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JVHisW73XDY?rel=0\"\n              class=\"embedVideo-iframe\"\n              style=\"border:0\"\n              \n              loading=\"eager\"\n              allowfullscreen\n\t      sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups\"\n            ></iframe>\n        </div></p>\n<p>\n        <div class=\"embedVideo-container\">\n            <iframe\n              title=\"\"\n              width=\"560\"\n              height=\"316\"\n              src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YAGkJpJ2pLY?rel=0\"\n              class=\"embedVideo-iframe\"\n              style=\"border:0\"\n              \n              loading=\"eager\"\n              allowfullscreen\n\t      sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups\"\n            ></iframe>\n        </div></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/7d6ff321-cd9a-4982-be42-94dd062b3c26/\" alt=\"\"></p>","excerpt":"The Association ‘Friends of Athanasakio Arheologicam Museum of Volos and archeological\r\nsites of Magnesia and Northern Sporades islands’ was…","frontmatter":{"title":"Heritage actions during EYCH2018, through citizen involvement in the promotion of museums in Magnesia, Greece","pubstatus":"completed","date":"a month ago","target_audience":["PROFESSIONAL","VISITOR"],"pageId":"6e26ed44-9350-4178-a5e1-a7003407ef42","license":"CC BY 2.0","thumbnail":"https://ucarecdn.com/995dc2a2-ae67-4497-a3e5-a6bf54b66c52/","abstract":null,"challengesbestpractice":"n/a","desc":"The Association ‘Friends of Athanasakio Arheological Museum of Volos’ during the European Year of Cultural Heritage 2018 (EYCH2018) aimed to contribute to the initiative on ‘Tourism and heritage’ by involving the local host community to inform visitors.

Key stakeholders were provided a collaborative space to innovate and experiment, resulting in interdisciplinary projects. The goal was to create tailored multimedia experiences that are adaptable yet deeply personal for visitors. The emphasis was on enhancing indoor and outdoor spaces to enrich visitor experiences. Following the ReInHerit Hackathon, resources and networking platforms were available to support cultural tourism. The focus was cultivating a new generation of visitors, particularly teenagers and young adults, through interactive technologies and gamification. Diverse teams, including professionals from various fields, collaborated to develop projects that complement existing exhibitions and museum spaces. The Hackathon aimed to generate novel ideas and projects linking technology with museums and cultural heritage sites. Goals included developing apps, digital tools, or platforms for cultural preservation and promotion. Additionally, the event facilitated Artistic Expressions for Cultural Sites, encouraging artistic works to engage the public. The outcomes featured innovative ideas and products enhancing smart tourism, with interdisciplinary teams fostering collaboration and idea sharing. The primary outcomes of the Hackathon included:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>App Prototypes: Functional apps to enhance museum experiences, reaching TRL3.</li>\n<li>Business Ideas: Plans addressing value propositions, customer segments, and revenue streams.</li>\n<li>Game Prototypes: Interactive games educating about museums and history.\r\nParticipants included students, designers, engineers, developers, startups, and cultural heritage professionals.\r\nThe Smart Tourism Hackathon was co-organized by two EU-funded projects, ReInHerit and DiGiNN.

Additional satellite events were organized with a total duration of two weeks before the main event.\r\nParticipants took part in the pre-hackathon webinars to get informed about the thematic of the hackathon and what would be expected to be delivered as a final project. Seven webinars (one introduction to the hackathon and six for the three thematic) were hosted by the mentors invited to participate in the main event to present projects and ideas based on their related background for app prototypes, business ideas, and game prototypes. The webinars were held virtually using the Zoom platform. In each webinar, around fifteen people participated.\r\nThe esteemed mentors of the hackathon, a group of seasoned professionals and experts in various fields, played a crucial role in guiding and inspiring participants with their wealth of knowledge and experience. Mentors and the judging panel were selected based on their professional background, which should be related to the main thematic of the hackathon. Mentors could also be involved in the ReInHerit - Redefining the Future of Cultural Heritage, funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement No 101004545 so that they were able to guide participants on cultural heritage, museums, and more.

Responding to this situation, NiMAC (Nicosia Municipal Arts Centre) took the initiative to mobilize and motivate Cultural and Creative Industries (CCIs).

The Creative and Cultural Industry has been identified as an important contributor to the new economic model by renewing urban space and promoting creative tourism.<br>\n<br>\nThe festival receives applications from startups, business professionals, young entrepreneurs, art retailers (e.g. art exhibitions, installations, theatre, music, and dance shows and performances), as well as education experts (e.g. workshops, courses, lectures, and other related activities) and craftsmen.<br>\n<br>\nAlthough the practice began as a 6-week festival it has had a broader impact. The festival is a precursor of the Nicosia’s “Creative Business Quarter” strategic plan and a catalyst for upgrading municipal plans of urban revitalization, enrichment of cultural policies and improvement of urban mobility plans. The Nicosia Municipality has therefore taken a strategic aim to provide yearly investments into developing the space where CCI can flourish while also improving the aesthetics of degraded urban areas.<br>\n<br>\nThis practice could be of other policy makers seeking to use the potential of CCI for strengthening the local economy and can be especially interesting in the Covid-19 crisis context. As international tourism will most likely not return to its former volume in the months to come, initiatives such as a CCI festival can increase the attractiveness of a municipality for internal tourism.</p>\n<!--EndFragment-->\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/de8d648d-1ca4-4d22-b88d-de087da63410/\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>NiMAC [Nicosia Municipal Arts Centre, Associated with the Pierides Foundation / Old Powerhouse] is housed in the renovated building of the Old Powerhouse, located in the historical centre of Nicosia after an agreement between the Electricity Authority of Cyprus and Nicosia Municipality.

The remains of the saline water were used to construct the Pannonian salt lakes complex in Tuzla.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/2380e9e4-5868-492b-857d-2e58d4b001f1/\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Within the complex of the Pannonian Lakes, in 2006, the first Archaeological Park of a Neolithic pile-dwelling settlement in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Southeast Europe was built and opened.\r\nThe Archaeological Park represents a reconstruction of a part of the Neolithic pile-dwelling settlement discovered in Tuzla. The park is an open-air museum that aims to present to visitors a portion of the archaeological and historical past of the city of Tuzla, as well as the way of life, both material and spiritual, especially the first salt production in the Neolithic era.</p>\n<p>The Archaeological Park includes a semi-circular foundation curved around a hilly elevation, a leveled part of the hill arranged as a central plateau on which totem poles, a replica clay oven, a weaving hut, etc., are placed, 5 dwellings of characteristic shapes and dimensions, two smaller foundations connected by central foundations with wooden bridges to four more dwellings.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/257e222c-cd4a-47e4-b458-f38b624ad890/\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The first discovery of objects from the Neolithic era in Tuzla dates back to 1903. During work on regulating Appel Plac, now Trg slobode (Freedom Square), some archaeological material was excavated, providing the first indications of the existence of a Neolithic settlement in the Tuzla area. The archaeological material consisted of three perforated and polished hammers, a ceramic foot made of clay with traces of fine sand, and a large ball used as a grain crusher. After the expert analysis of these items, it was concluded that there was a Neolithic settlement in the present-day Tuzla area whose inhabitants, in addition to traditional livelihoods, also utilized sources of saline water.</p>\n<p>Despite its interest and importance, this discovery was not sufficient to provide detailed information about the type, size, wealth, and true age of the settlement. It wasn't until 1955, in Rudarska Street, today's Džafer Mahala, that enough archaeological material was excavated, unequivocally confirming that there was a large and prosperous Neolithic pile-dwelling settlement in Tuzla, one of the oldest in Europe – with only one other Neolithic pile-dwelling settlement discovered in Switzerland.</p>\n<p>Supporting the assumption that Neolithic inhabitants exploited saline sources are the discovered fragments of coarse pottery that, according to the opinions of contemporary top archaeologists, were used for isolating saline water. Two vessels have been reconstructed, one dating back to 3,500 years before the Common Era and the other to 5,000 years before the Common Era. Thus, from the Neolithic era to the present day, people in the Tuzla area have been producing salt.</p>\n<p>The Neolithic vessels for isolating saline water serve as evidence that the pile-dwelling settlement in Tuzla was the first known Neolithic settlement whose inhabitants exploited this precious mineral. The oldest European cultures that used salt are dated to the Copper Age, meaning that the Neolithic discovery in Tuzla shifts the boundary of knowledge and use of salt in human diet from the Eneolithic to the Neolithic.</p>\n<p>All findings provide evidence of the high culture of the inhabitants of this region during the flourishing of ancient cultures in Vinča and Butmir.</p>\n<p>Since 2006 this Archaeology Park has become one of the tourist products of Tuzla, at first mainly relying on the visitors who come to visit the Pannonian Lakes, but now majority of visitors are pre-school children and students, as the visit to the Archaeology park is not only entertaining but also educational.</p>\n<p>In 2012 an addition was made to the Archaeology park with opening of the Geological Exhibition 'Pannonica' which represents a significant element for the development of cultural tourism in the city of Tuzla, as it speaks to the continuity of life in this area and complements the offerings of the Pannonian Lakes complex.</p>\n<p>\n        <div class=\"embedVideo-container\">\n            <iframe\n              title=\"\"\n              width=\"560\"\n              height=\"316\"\n              src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qC4xiH5LYwg?rel=0\"\n              class=\"embedVideo-iframe\"\n              style=\"border:0\"\n              \n              loading=\"eager\"\n              allowfullscreen\n\t      sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups\"\n            ></iframe>\n        </div></p>","excerpt":"Tuzla is a city whose name and history are closely tied to salt, a natural wealth that remained beneath Tuzla after the withdrawal of the…","frontmatter":{"title":"Archaeology in the function of developing a new tourist product","pubstatus":"completed","date":"20 days ago","target_audience":["PROFESSIONAL","VISITOR"],"pageId":"20ddea8c-b951-495a-985a-d961ec3fe8e7","license":"CC BY 2.0","thumbnail":"https://ucarecdn.com/94a48d26-a4f3-4014-92ec-296de3f9903f/","abstract":null,"challengesbestpractice":"The Archaeology park was faced with a challenge of the need to reconstruct the pile dwellings due to weather effects and there was a need to ensure sufficient funding for the rehabilitation of the dwellings.

A notable structural intervention involved the replacement of the metal stairs in the stairwell tower and the envelope, along with the corresponding structure of the fitness room.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, all existing facilities underwent a complete replacement with new additions to meet contemporary needs and standards. The restructuring allowed for the highlighting of representative historical spaces through a new circuit. This involved regrouping changing areas and freeing up spaces around the pool. Additionally, by reorganizing annexed spaces, there was a successful reintroduction into the public circuit, which included the industrial body of the thermal plant dating back to the early 19th century.</p>\n<p>Today, Baia Populară has been reborn, featuring expanded spaces, technological modernization, and a completely restored and renovated historical building. This transformation unveils the beauty of a tradition spanning over 100 years, seamlessly blending the rich heritage with contemporary elements. The revitalized establishment now offers new services and facilities designed to cater to both the local community and tourists visiting Sibiu.</p>\n<p>The extensive renovation project has opened new areas for exploration, including the loft which now houses offices and rooms specifically designed for various sports, educational, or relaxation activities. The basement has been dedicated to supporting vulnerable social categories, emphasizing the project's commitment to inclusivity. Additionally, visitors can now explore the water tower, where the former 5,000-litre reservoir has been replaced by a serene relaxation area offering a breathtaking view of the city.</p>\n<p>The first-floor terrace, encircling the inner courtyard, has been revived to evoke a sense of relaxation and tranquility in the sunlight, reminiscent of times past.</p>\n<p>The Public Bath services are now more accessible to individuals with special needs, thanks to the installation of an elevator that seamlessly connects all floors, from the basement to the loft. This thoughtful addition ensures that everyone can enjoy the facilities without hindrance. Moreover, the gym has been equipped with facilities tailored to accommodate the specific needs of individuals with disabilities, further enhancing inclusivity and accessibility. A cutting-edge software solution has been developed to generate computerized training routines, making it accessible for individuals with disabilities, including those who use wheelchairs.</p>\n<p>The revitalization of the Sibiu Public Bath has sparked a renewed interest in sports practices, offering a diverse range of activities. The facility now conducts swimming courses for children, as well as yoga and Pilates classes.</p>\n<p>To enhance convenience, booking for all services is seamlessly facilitated online.

It comprises archaeological sites, museums, monuments, artworks, historic cities, literary and musical work, and is an important element of social life, as well as economic development. The recent COVID-19 pandemic substantially impacted access to heritage, leading to increased interest in sites that could be accessed digitally. According to the UNESCO’s Charter on the Preservation of the Digital Heritage, digitalisation helps to preserve heritage for the future and allows it to be accessed in any part of the world. Unprecedented opportunities enabled by technologies bring cultural heritage sites back to life. The sector’s transformation has led to easier online access to cultural material for everybody. This good practice is an excellent example of the use of digitalisation, specifically virtual reality, through which visitors can experience historical events, landscape, nature, architecture, and local customs. The good practice can easily be replicated and transferred to other regions in Europe.</p>\n<p>\n        <div class=\"embedVideo-container\">\n            <iframe\n              title=\"\"\n              width=\"560\"\n              height=\"316\"\n              src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CyW_oYSYSlc?rel=0\"\n              class=\"embedVideo-iframe\"\n              style=\"border:0\"\n              \n              loading=\"eager\"\n              allowfullscreen\n\t      sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups\"\n            ></iframe>\n        </div></p>","excerpt":"It is a 3D animated world which shows various life events, landscape, nature, architecture, and local customs.

In 478 B.C, locals acceded in the first naval alliance with Athens and, sometime later, they acceded in the second. Over the next turbulent times, Macedonians, Romans, ancient Venetians and Ottoman Turks were constantly using the island as their base for their conquering plans.</p>\n<p>After the Russian-Turkish wars, locals were given the right to build small ships on the island.
