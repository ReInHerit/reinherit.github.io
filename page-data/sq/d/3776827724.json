The event, which took place on May 19th, 2023, at the Bank of Cyprus Cultural Foundation (BoCCF) in Nicosia, Cyprus, coincided with the International Museum Day and the European Museum Night. The BoCCF, serving as the host organization for ReInHerit H2020, provided an ideal venue for the event, combining museological function, archaeological exhibits, and an outdoor amphitheater used for performing arts.  </p>\n<p>CYENS created an immersive performance within and around a museum, consisting of a temporary large-scale audiovisual installation, combining live electronic sound with a group of 20 live music performers, theatrical lighting, generative video art and projection mapping, a digital exhibition, and an augmented reality (AR) smartphone app that allowed visitors to interact with the installation during the event.  </p>\n<p>The challenge of organizing a performance within a museum, a space not originally designed for live events, prompted collaboration with the Cyprus Symphony Orchestra and the Cyprus Youth Symphony Orchestra. The performance unfolded across various museum spaces, including exhibition rooms, the courtyard, and the building's main staircase. This departure from conventional museum etiquette, where silence is encouraged, transformed the museum into a concert hall, adding layers of sound and interaction to the visitor experience.  </p>\n<p>The immersive experience was achieved through an interplay of live music, sound art, video art, lighting design, programming for the AR application, and digital exhibition curation. The goal was to create a site-specific, exhibit-specific, time-limited, and adaptable multimedia experience, allowing visitors to engage with the museum on a personal level.  </p>\n<p>The musical component featured a unique sound installation with 14 stations triggered by an AR app. Audience interaction with virtual exhibits influenced live performances, creating a dynamic, co-created music piece. The performance successfully merged with the museum, adding an unprecedented layer of sound and interaction to the exhibits.  </p>\n<p>The visual component of \"ReInHerit a Museum\" merges the Bank of Cyprus Cultural Foundation's (BoCCF) historical artifacts with Generative and Video Art. Integrating algorithms, the performance creates a dynamic audiovisual landscape, encouraging diverse interpretations of Cyprus' cultural heritage. BoCCF exhibits and AI-generated dancer images are transformed in real-time, using techniques such as photogrammetry and projection mapping, resulting in a dynamic, ever-evolving painting in time.  </p>\n<p>A significant aspect of the project involved the development of an AR application showcasing virtual exhibits from the BoCCF's ethnographic collection. These 3D-scanned objects, displayed alongside the museum's existing exhibits, allowed visitors to interact with the virtual exhibition and gain insights into 19th-century Cypriot daily life.</p>\n<p>A comprehensive advertisement campaign in social media platforms and local newspapers, along with the release of a performance highlights video, aimed to maintain audience interest. The overarching objective was to attract a diverse audience, particularly younger demographics, fostering a new generation of museum visitors.  </p>\n<p>\"ReInHerit a Museum: Immersive Performance at the BoCCF\" exemplifies the successful fusion of technology, music, and visual art to transform a museum into a dynamic, interactive space. The project not only fulfilled its goals of audience engagement and site enhancement but also provided valuable insights for future projects within cultural heritage sites.  </p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aVizAmxtWHc?si=vtSiqXGnx-GPBrBZ\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","excerpt":"“ReInHerit a Museum: Immersive Performance at the BoCCF” was the second and final case study organized within the framework of the ReInHerit…","frontmatter":{"pageId":"efc245bd-2d29-4636-9175-12645bbf1edd","title":"“ReInHerit a Museum: Immersive Performance at the BoCCF”: overview","date":"11 days ago","target_audience":["PROFESSIONAL"],"thumbnail":null}}},{"node":{"html":"<p>From a museological point of view, the main idea behind the performance, followed that of the previous immersive performance organized under ReInHerit: the museum and the premises of the BoCCF would not constitute just a performance site simply hosting the event, but that the performance would merge with the museum and constitute an enhancement of the visitor experience. Thus, the aim was to provide to the visitors a different way of experiencing and getting to know the actual museum, a way that goes beyond the typical museum visit, which is usually centred around textual ways of interpretation. Therefore, we aimed to create additional layers of experience that can trigger the senses. This endeavour would allow each visitor to experience the museum in their own personal way and create their own meaning based on their personal interests.    </p>\n<p>The BoCCF has a large and very rich ethnographic collection, which is not accessible to the public. Therefore, it was decided that the AR application that would be designed for the performance could be used to bring these objects to the public and create a \"virtual\" exhibition, presented alongside the Museum of George and Nefeli Giabra Pierides Collection and the temporary exhibitions of the BoCCF.  </p>\n<p>Artefacts from the ethnographic collection of the BoCCF were selected and 3D scanned, and were available through the AR application, such as a traditional vase, a brazier, a throne, a wooden chest, a gilded buckle, and a talisman, amongst others. The exhibits of this \"virtual\" exhibition were scattered around the premises of the building and became visible based on the audiences’ interactions. The virtual exhibition consisted of 12 objects of folk art from the Pierides ethnographic collection, mainly from the 19th century, which were used in the daily life of that time, such as examples of silversmithing, woodcarving, ceramics and metalwork. Through this virtual exhibition, a “dialogue” was created with the artefacts currently on display from the archaeological collection and the other temporary exhibitions.  </p>\n<p>Through the application, visitors could see these objects and also interact with them, by turning them around to see all sides of the objects and also zoom into details that were described in the accompanying texts. For each object, an accompanying text was available through the application, which provided the context of the object and described its use in the daily life of the people in the 19th century. The texts were written in a simple language, avoiding academic jargon so that they can be easily read by younger audiences as well. The texts were the result of thorough research for each of the selected objects, and, apart from providing a basic way of interpretation, they also aimed to help visitors to imagine the daily life in Cyprus in the 19th century.  </p>\n<p>The interpretation material created was standalone for each object, so that visitors could have a full experience even if they did not see all objects and irrespective of the order in which they saw the objects and texts. Thus, the experience was not designed to be linear, but visitors could walk freely within the space, deciding where to spend more time as they wished and according to their interest.  </p>\n<p>In order to create this experience, the selected objects had to be scanned for the AR application. However, some objects could not be scanned properly due to the nature of their material (e.g., glass or other reflective surfaces). Therefore, some objects initially selected could not be included or had to be replaced by other objects that did not have such problems. Thus, the narrative was affected by technological aspects relating to the scanning process. Also, since these objects are not currently displayed to the public, for some of them there was no available information, and so a lot of research had to be done to trace their origins and related context. These were some of the main challenges faced during the development process.</p>","excerpt":"From a museological point of view, the main idea behind the performance, followed that of the previous immersive performance organized under…","frontmatter":{"pageId":"c50742e6-67b5-44b1-881d-73ccd5e92605","title":"Museological Perspectives","date":"11 days ago","target_audience":["PROFESSIONAL"],"thumbnail":null}}},{"node":{"html":"<p>This document presents a short description for the setting up and usage of the source code developed to support the immersive performance for the ReInHerit project that took place at the Bank of Cyprus Cultural Foundation on the 19th of May 2023.

Historical artifacts and algorithms merged to create a unique audiovisual landscape that stimulated new interpretations, multiple perspectives, and a dynamic dialogue about the past, the present, and the future of the corresponding exhibits.  </p>\n<p>In the subsequent phase, 8 area scans were generated, each corresponding to the location of a specific object, strategically positioned across various locations within the museum to encourage visitors to browse through and explore the building and its collections during the event. The audience scanned the objects in the corresponding area, and consequently, the three-dimensional model appeared on a tablet or their mobile devices along with object descriptions and historical information about the original exhibit.  </p>\n<p>Following this stage, these conserved reference points embarked on a gradual orbit around the central axis of each object within the dimensions of x, y, and z. The traces of these movements were captured and presented in real time to spectators via the projection. This intricate procedure culminated in a visual effect reminiscent of the stroke of a brush as it gracefully glides across canvas or paper, thus achieving a uniquely creative and abstract visual outcome. This culmination stands as a testament to the museum’s very essence and mission.  </p>\n<p><b>Technical Characteristics of the Real-Time Visuals</b>  </p>\n<p>The visual aspect encompasses algorithmic graphics and the aesthetics of video art. Initially, three-dimensional models of exhibits were created using photogrammetry, and architectural elements were retained in the node-based software, Touch Designer (<a href=\"https://derivative.ca/\">https://derivative.ca/</a>). Additionally, Artificial Intelligence-generated images of dancers were created using e-Dally (<a href=\"https://openai.com/dall-e-2\">https://openai.com/dall-e-2</a>) and integrated into a timeline, allowing for smooth transitions and intermediate states. These elements were integrated into a system created in Touch Designer, where audience input and MIDI controller inter- actions shaped the final artwork.  </p>\n<p><b>The Video-Art</b>  </p>\n<p>The video art was created using AI-generated images of dancers. These images were then imported into a video editing program, and utilizing the technique of morphing, intermediate images were generated. This process gave rise to the movement and, consequently, the video. The final form of the moving images resulted from a combination of the created video by the dancers and real-time graphics through projection mapping.  </p>\n<p><b>Projection Mapping</b>  </p>\n<p>Projection mapping played a crucial role in the immersive experience. The exterior side of the venues’ building and an amphitheater in the courtyard were utilized for it. By selecting two opposing points in the courtyard, the audience was fully immersed in visuals and music, creating a sense of unity. Three programs worked simultaneously in real-time: Touch Designer generated the graphics, Syphon (<a href=\"https://syphon.github.io/\">https://syphon.github.io/</a>) trans- ported them to Mad Mapper (<a href=\"https://madmapper.com/\">https://madmapper.com/</a>), which facilitated the mapping onto the building’s surface.  </p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gninGRoY9A?si=aEANORbEEcyl-Iqg\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","excerpt":"The Visual Part   The visual component of the performance combined exhibits from the BoCCF with generative art and video art, resulting in a…","frontmatter":{"pageId":"2a98cf27-db12-48d9-8982-2729731600d3","title":"Video Art","date":"11 days ago","target_audience":["PROFESSIONAL"],"thumbnail":null}}}]}}}
