Together with our project partners, we created the foundation for a network of cultural heritage professionals and built a freely accessible platform for digital exchange, presentation and experimentation (Digital Hub) based on intensive research.</p>\n<p> By uploading your digital collection object, you can <b>share and add a new perspective</b> to the three topics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ReThinking <b>Conflicts</b></li>\n<li>ReThinking <b>Identities</b></li>\n<li>ReThinking <b>Craftsmanship</b>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The ReInHerit partner museums “Graz Museum”, “Museum of Cycladic Art” and”Bank of Cyprus Cultural Foundation” elaborated the base of the three Thematic Areas and developed three Travelling Exhibitions, three Digital Exhibitions and the Digital Collection. These will go live from February 2023 on.</p>\n<p>As our contributions only show and represent one perspective on the topics, we invite institutions all over Europe to contribute their digital collection objects (3D and 2D) to achieve a broader and more heterogeneous representation of the respective Thematic Areas. A core benefit of sharing your digital objects lies in the opportunity for other institutions to use them in their exhibitions. This open exchange of digital objects enables museums around Europe to incorporate expanded perspectives into their future exhibition narratives, thereby giving room to more diverse voices.</p>\n<p><b>Together we create a European Collection to illustrate the rich diversity in the portfolio of the cultural sector and show the variety of perspectives on the respective topics.</b></p>\n<p><strong>How to contribute?</strong></p>\n<p>Simply submit one or several of your collection objects and information on the objects <a href=\"https://forms.gle/RcDdX8fvaDbdx78V7\">via this form</a>.

Have you always wanted to take on a travelling exhibition that allows you to include your own local perspective and references? Are you thinking about innovative and affordable ways to exhibit digital representations of objects in your physical museum space? Are you intent upon offering an exhibition that specifically attracts a young audience?  </p>\n<p>The ReInHerit exhibitions are travelling exhibitions designed for small and medium-sized museums. They presently cover a small fraction of the Thematic Areas \"Conflicts\", \"Craftsmanship\" and \"Identities\", but have the potential to accommodate a large number of objects and perspectives. They provides a modular structure for the physical space and can accomodate an extended object selection from the ReInHerit digital collection. The ReInHerit exhibitions are analogue and digital at the same time. They are designed to be easily adaptable, extendable and interactive.  </p>\n<p>The Travelling Exhibitions aim to be shown in as many different places as possible. To this end, they are designed in such a way that they can also be taken over at smaller and medium-sized museums without major costs and changes. The exhibition designs are structurally conceived like a puzzle, which can be expanded with new puzzle elements that can be filled with their own narrative strands and objects. The objects will be shared digitally and the easy to implement exhibition architecture can be produced regionally and with locally available resources with the help of concrete instructions.  </p>\n<h3>How to host a Travelling Exhibition</h3>\n<p>The exhibition concept consists of various puzzle components and aspires to be expanded. Therefore, the already provided content (audios, texts, digital objects) can be taken up and extended with new content and objects from the respective museum/cultural institution. The exhibition grows with each takeover.  </p>\n<p>In the exceptional case that an interested institution cannot add its own content or would like to show an existing puzzle element within a thematically matching exhibition, it can also be taken on without changes and can be shown without individual extension.</p>\n<h4>Four steps to hosting your own exhibition:</h4>\n<p><strong>1. DOWNLOAD INFORMATION</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Thematic Areas  </li>\n<li>Exhibition Architecture  </li>\n<li>Content Implementation  </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2. CREATE A NARRATIVE</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Select a topic  </li>\n<li>Choose objects  </li>\n<li>Find key objects  </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3. ORGANISE THE CONSTRUCTION</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Check the dimensions of the exhibition space  </li>\n<li>Check what media are needed  </li>\n<li>Find local workshops and (reused) material  </li>\n<li>Install the structure and the devices  </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>4.
