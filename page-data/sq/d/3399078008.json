Given the fact that many museums and heritage sites, especially smaller ones, continue to suffer from inefficient management due to lack of funding and support, as well as the pressures of ongoing crises, it is crucial for them to set up a CHM plan.  In doing so, they should take into account a wide range of aspects and processes, such as: legislation, identification, assessment, statutory protection, conservation (preservation, restoration, reconstruction, adaptation), rehabilitation and revitalization, use, maintenance, guarding, interpretation, presentation, monitoring, control, and research. It is worth noting, that there are considerable variations in the context and character of a CHM plan, depending on the type of property. For example, drafting a management plan for an archaeological site, a major museum or an urban center, would be definitely a complex procedure. Instead, drafting a management plan for a single historic building or a small museum can be simpler</p>\n<h3>What is a CHM plan for museums and heritage sites?</h3>\n<p>A CHM plan is a succinct document that explains management issues, approaches and requirements relating to museums and heritage sites and sets a framework for decision making over a given period of time. It should be sufficiently flexible, clear, simple, management oriented and easily understood.</p>\n<h3>What are the main objectives of a CHM plan?</h3>\n<p>The overall objectives of a CHM plan are to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>protect the values of the cultural heritage for present and future generations</li>\n<li>promote effective sustainability practices</li>\n<li>balance and coordinate cultural heritage needs against those of cultural heritage ‘users’</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What are the major issues that almost every CHM plan should address?</h3>\n<p>The first step a museum or a heritage site must take in order to develop and implement a successful management plan is to understand the needs, challenges and bottlenecks of this era. Having fully understood the needs and challenges of this era, as well as the potential opportunities, museums and heritage sites should create management plans which, among other things, must include strategies for the following issues:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Collection Management</li>\n<li>Audience and local communities’ engagement</li>\n<li>Energy and environmental Management</li>\n<li>Intellectual Property (IP) Management</li>\n<li>New ‘Business’ Models and Financing</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Recommendations on issues to be included in a CHM plan</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Setting up strategies</strong> accompanied by clear policies, guidelines, and possibly a road map on strategies implementation and resource allocation can facilitate the success of CHM process.\r\nSome examples are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A <strong>Communication strategy</strong>, specifically social media policies, must be agreed and adopted. It is important to acknowledge the different demands of internal and external information-sharing and must be regularly tuned to meet changing needs. Various communication tools, some of them borrowed from other sectors, can facilitate the effective implementation of the Cultural Heritage Management plan.</li>\n<li>An <strong>Intellectual Property strategy</strong>, with an emphasis on copyright, reinforces cultural heritage as an asset, ensures that no third-party IP assets are infringed, and contributes towards the effectiveness of the Cultural Heritage Management plan. As WIPO has convincingly argued, copyright protection is above all one of the means of promoting, enriching, and disseminating national cultural heritage.</li>\n<li>Finally, setting up an <strong>Environmental and Energy strategy</strong> is also important in order to create an effective policy framework for decision making and implementation in relation to environmental and cultural heritage sustainability. It is crucial in order to revisit and adapt environmental plans, to reduce energy consumption, to improve sustainability of buildings, to find alternative energy sources and to have guidance on how to address the energy and cost of living crisis. This seems more relevant now, as humanity faces a new energy and cost of living crisis that followed the war in Ukraine (2022).<br/></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To ensure the effectiveness of the CHM plan, a wide basis of professional and scientific knowledge and skills are required. The operation’s responsibility is to train and induct all employees in cultural heritage matters so as to avoid mistakes and failures in the implementation of the CHM plan. <strong>Training</strong> gives heritage practitioners the opportunity to increase their operational efficiency and the effectiveness of heritage management practice. In this respect, tools such as marketing plans, business plans, strategic plans, project management software helps practitioners to work more efficiently. Furthermore, cultural awareness training is a process that can inform and educate people about key issues related to cultural heritage with the intention of influencing their attitudes, behaviours, and beliefs, towards the achievement of a defined goal. This can, subsequently, facilitate the success of the CHM plan.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Setting up organograms</strong> is also important in order to show hierarchical relationships between managers and the people who report to them, as well as departments. In addition, effective implementation of management planning also depends on coordinating the contribution of all relevant stakeholders and this requires particular skills.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Evaluation process</strong> is also of paramount importance for the successful implementation of the CHM plan. It concerns self-evaluation and external evaluation that should take place on a regular basis. Furthermore, monitoring is an important instrument of reviewing given the fact that when a CHM plan comes into practice changes must be expected.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Due to its interdisciplinary nature, the CHM must be based upon effective <strong>collaboration and communication between professionals from various disciplines</strong>. Synergies and networks may be valuable in this respect. It also requires the involvement of government authorities, academic researchers, universities, research institutions and the general public. Effective implementation of management planning largely depends on supervision by an interdisciplinary team of specialists relevant to the problems being addressed. This team can deliver appropriate responses to emerging needs during implementation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Digital technologies offer solutions to successfully implement a CHM plan. For example, the <strong>use of innovative tools</strong> can facilitate the targeting of audiences, the understanding of their needs and the effective response to them (e.g., tourists, younger audience, local communities, minorities, Special Needs Groups).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Implementing <strong>codes of conduct</strong> can ensure that targets are pursued, and any tasks are implemented considering ethics and deontology and minimizing risks in this area.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Hybridisation of roles</strong> within organisations of the sector, (e.g., collection’s manager working also with outreach activities).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Use of existing programs for cultural heritage professionals</strong> (e.g., ‘Erasmus programme’ for professionals).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Schemes/systems to <strong>make professionals change roles</strong> within &#x26; between\r\norganisations to provide new perspectives and develop innovation capacity.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Intra-museum collaboration</strong> as a means of developing niche or audience\r\nspecialization.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Climate and Energy Responsible Museums","pageId":"37afc991-6d46-4fce-b437-812e3790506c","date":"7 months ago","target_audience":["PROFESSIONAL"],"layout":"blog","theme":"Management","thumbnail":null,"mainImage":"https://ucarecdn.com/8b4e945a-ce41-442f-8230-4c549cdd49a9/","abstract":"Climate change and the energy crisis are the most complex challenges humanity faces, which are radically altering human lifeways and ecosystems.

The European Union has identified climate change and the energy crisis as urgent and complex challenges that need to be addressed across all sectors. As such, a crucial issue is how the cultural heritage (CH) sector can contribute meaningfully to overcome these challenges by investigating every possible way to support the sustainable transition of Europe. CH sector’s commitment towards society is related to climate, energy, and environmental concerns. Museums and heritage sites, regardless of their size and resources, have the opportunity to play the key role of change makers and leaders locally and globally in order to better respond to challenges confronted by the communities they serve. They are called not only to be relevant to the visitor and their interests, but also to be relevant participants in the world. Tackling the current energy and climate crisis requires immediate actions and a radical and urgent approach in the context of Cultural Heritage Management (CHM). Museums and heritage sites need to take actions to adjust to current effects of climate change and prepare for the predicted impacts in the future. Furthermore, they need to support improved solutions and new approaches so as to work in an energy-efficient manner.</p>\n<h3>Setting up an Environmental and Energy strategy</h3>\n<p>In the context of the CHM plan, museums and heritage sites should set up an Environmental and Energy strategy in order to create an effective policy framework for decision making and implementation in relation to the sustainable transition of Europe. This is an absolutely essential step to contribute to climate action, to adapt to the effects of the climate and energy crisis, to prepare for foreseen or unforeseen impacts in the future, to review and adapt environmental plans, to reduce energy consumption, to improve the sustainability of buildings, to find alternative energy sources, to have guidance on how to deal with the energy crisis and the cost of living, and to help the public to better understand these urgent challenges and become more active.</p>\n<h3>What issues and principles an efficient Environmental and Energy strategy should take into account?</h3>\n<p>The following recommendations are intended to support CH professionals in designing an effective Environmental and Energy strategy in the context of their CHM plan: <br/></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Adopt a broader view founded on realistic thinking and immediate action.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Be aware of the current or future global issues. Try to understand the bigger picture in order to better understand the specific role your organisation can play locally.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Engage everyone who can contribute to climate action.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Collaborate with governments, local authorities, policy makers, fund raisers and sponsors.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Explore new funding opportunities.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cultivate a culture of environmental and energy sustainability, and climate action. Museums and heritage sites as educational bodies can include in their mission to convey the important message of environmental and energy concerns so as to inspire people and activate individual and collective agency.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Create collections, exhibitions, and educational programs as well as undertake a variety of campaigns and community engagement activities (e.g., engage indigenous and traditional populations). These activities can be used as a vehicle to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>raise awareness</li>\n<li>inspire climate action</li>\n<li>build and share knowledge about human impacts on environment and climate as well as teach skills</li>\n<li>co-create positive responses</li>\n<li>foster community discussions that help communities craft better carbon reducing approaches for energy, water, waste, and infrastructure</li>\n<li>help local communities plan to become more climate-resilient <br/></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Engage artists and designers to find more creative responses to climate and energy crisis and propose solutions for how humanity might shape the future.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Conduct climate related research (community-based for action, audience-focused for heightened awareness and engagement, or technologically innovative for problem solving).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Encourage risk assessment, adaptation and mitigation for museums and heritage sites.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Analyse possible challenges resulting from climate change and energy crisis to each museum and heritage site.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Join in cultural climate-related networks and act in partnership with other CH professionals around Europe or experts outside the sector.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Train CH professionals in climate and energy issues, in order to better assess the opportunities for the CH sector to contribute meaningfully to the sustainable transition of Europe.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reduce energy consumption. Determine institution’s annual carbon footprint.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Stop promoting single-use plastics and select goods and materials with low environmental and climate impacts.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>How can the CH sector operate in energy efficient and sustainable ways?</h3>\n<p>Most of the museums and heritage sites have high fixed energy cost around collection care, while at the same time they have to manage energy inefficient buildings or open spaces. This makes them extremely vulnerable to unprecedented cost increases following a period of declining revenues during the pandemic. CH professionals currently feel that they have limited options and guidance to address this challenge. As a result, many museums and heritage sites will not be able to keep their doors open for at least a few days a week in order to save on energy costs. In the context of the research conducted during the ReInHerit project, the following activities were listed that facilitate museums and heritage sites to focus on managing their operations and collections in energy efficient and sustainable ways as well as on building sustainability into their long-term plans. <br/></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Good ventilation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Lights, unnecessary computers, printers, and laboratory equipment should be turned off overnight and when not in use during the day.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Replace dead light bulbs with energy-efficient alternatives in needed places. Use also natural light.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Use air-conditioning less.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>All printers should be default set to print on both sides of the paper and reuse paper when possible.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Increase electronic communication.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Conduct regularly energy audits. The energy audit should be regularly analyzed to determine the carbon footprint of conservation activities. As a response to the energy audit recommendations the museums can set an action plan.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Rinsing treatments should be revised to assess water flow, duration, and potential for reuse of rinse water.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Set temperature settings in accord with human comfort.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Review environmental standards for collections to identify potential energy savings.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Place timers or motion sensors for lights where possible.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Make adaptations to the building, such as insulation and draft reduction, to reduce energy loss.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Explore regularly alternative sources of green energy production and heat generation.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Bridging Museums/Heritage Sites and Local Communities","pageId":"a0331a12-f840-4958-80d9-707e954ae89e","date":"7 months ago","target_audience":["PROFESSIONAL"],"layout":"blog","theme":"Management","thumbnail":null,"mainImage":"https://ucarecdn.com/0170d01b-968f-4609-9d13-01441d645639/","abstract":"Local communities are considered as a key stakeholder in the cultural heritage (CH) sector.

Local communities are considered as a key stakeholder in the CH sector. There is an ever-increasing need for CH professionals to establish a deep connection and relationship with their local. It is clear that community support is of vital importance for the sustainable management of CH and the survival of most of the museums and heritage sites around Europe. CH professionals are particularly eager to interact with their communities, to play crucial roles in their lives, and establish themselves as relevant and valuable assets to them.</p>\n<h3>What challenges do museums face in engaging local communities?</h3>\n<p>When museums and heritage sites are working with local communities, they are facing many challenges. Some of these challenges can be summarised as follows: <br/></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Demographics are changing faster than ever, making societies more racially and ethnically pluralistic. Therefore, engaging local communities is more complex.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Lack of specific resources and skills within the organisation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Museum leadership and staff are not always committed to engaging local communities with CH.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Lack of appropriate funding and support.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For local communities intangible heritage is a prerequisite of their livelihood and existence. Traditionally more focus has been placed on tangible heritage than on intangible heritage by museums and heritage sites.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>There is a problem in finding the right balance between preserving the character of the local community but, at the same time, ensuring the sustainability and authenticity of the tourist product as well.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Over-dependency on tourism: In many places, tourism is taken for granted and not enough attention is paid to the local public.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>How can museums address these challenges?</h3>\n<p><strong>Recommendations</strong> <br/></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Set Community <strong>Involvement Action Plans</strong> (or Community Engagement Strategies).

This factsheet gives an overview of the challenges faced by museums in attracting young people and provides some practical recommendations to consider in order to support communication between CH professionals and young audiences, creating a deep connection between them."},"excerpt":"Museums and their young audience Although young people are an age group that is included in many categories of audiences, such as tourists…","html":"<h3>Museums and their young audience</h3>\n<p>Although young people are an age group that is included in many categories of audiences, such as tourists, local people, minorities, people with disabilities, etc., and varies according to country and regions, it is important for museums and heritage sites to record them as a distinct group. Young people should appear as an important target visitor group in a wide range of activities included in Cultural Heritage Management (CHM), such as audience development, collection management, marketing, digitisation, exhibition, etc. The ReInHerit project places particular emphasis on persons between the ages of 18 and 29. Cultural Heritage (CH) professionals who participated in the focus groups were particularly eager to make CH more relevant to these ages, to attract and convince them to attend museums and heritage sites, and to make them positive stakeholders of CH.</p>\n<h3>What problems do museums face in attracting young people?</h3>\n<p>Museums and heritage sites are facing many problems in attracting young people from the time when youths leave school (i.e., 18 years old). The ReInHerit project identifies the following obstacles in the engagement of young people with CH: <br/></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Young people are not a homogeneous group and differentiation is needed.</strong> For example, there are differences between young people in urban environments and young people in the countryside or between young people in different countries. Furthermore, this age group includes many adolescents and children who are considered digital natives and use computers, social networking services and text messaging as their main means of communication and learning. Digital natives consume fast and in visual formats. They not only choose their content but also co-create and produce audiovisual content, which is dynamic and not static.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>There are conflicting views between CH professionals &#x26; young people on the nature of CH. <strong>Many young people perceive CH as something boring and museums and heritage sites as boring spaces.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Younger generations are reluctant to learn about the history of their region or about the CH of another country. <strong>Living in a globalised world, they often lose touch with their own roots, and they do not see the need to re-connect.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The inevitable shift towards digital technologies has a serious drawback when looking at the age group of 18 years and above. No matter how good the digital medium that museums are developing, it has not reached the sophistication and artistry and refinement already found in commercial digital media through games and other types of digital encounters. <strong>On many occasions museums and sites need to compete with commercial/state of the art technology.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The relationship between young people and CH cannot be seen as a mere matter of enjoyment.</strong> The interest in CH is not usually a stand-alone interest. It is also linked to history, education, ethics, personal development and fostering a culture in young people to respect and preserve CH for future generations.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>How can museums overcome these obstacles in order to be youth-friendly?</h3>\n<p><strong>Recommendations</strong> <br/></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Understand</strong> young people in order to determine their specific needs as well as how they perceive CH, how they experience it, how they want to engage with it, and what is important to them. This can help CH professionals renew the current view of CH and establish a new relationship based on collaborative and strong interaction, fostering innovation. To gain more knowledge about young people it is necessary to undertake research, consult, listen, analyse, respond and most importantly interact with them. In this respect, it is important for CH organisations to set out an <strong>audience development plan</strong>. A recommended tool is <strong>audience segmentation</strong> that involves thinking about audiences as distinct groups (e.g., organise social media campaigns to collect their views, etc.). For instance, understanding the behaviour of the emerging digital natives is important: they consume fast, in visual formats, they choose their content, they pursue variety and they do everything in a speedy way. Primary research, secondary research, quantitative research, and qualitative research, are important approaches that could be combined.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Promote real-time dialogue between young people and the CH professional.</strong> Give young people space to reflect on the whole idea of what heritage is and become part of the dynamic process of shaping information about heritage. A recommended tool is to create chat rooms for discussions between young people and CH professionals on the organisations' websites or interact with them on social media.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Introduce seminars, games, and digital tools</strong> (Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality/Mixed reality, Gesture Technology/Non-touch Interactives, Haptic technologies, Mobile Technologies, Virtual touring, etc.) in museums and heritage sites to attract younger audiences. As evidenced by the visitors’ survey conducted by the ReInHerit project, young museum visitors (18-29 as well as 30-44) are more likely to use digital tools in a museum environment. Younger people in general have a strong tendency to be interested in technology related experiences and in gamification approaches.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Foster synergies with other CH organisations and sites</strong> to develop maker-space environments and travelling programs to build new relationships with young people using new technologies.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Train CH professionals</strong> in audience research, marketing, and communication (e.g., social media), in order to better understand and approach young people, lifting the barriers that prevent them from engaging with CH. It is important to convince the staff of museums and heritage sites that young audiences are relevant for their work and that it is worth developing a mutual understanding.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Design and implement outreach work/activities to schools, universities, and youth organizations</strong> in order to educate youth before they come to the museum or create the desire for them to visit the museum and the heritage site. It is important to bring schools/universities and museums/heritage sites together in a context of a fruitful interaction. Perhaps CH professionals can bring them some intriguing artefacts and encourage them to visit museums and heritage sites to see the rest.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Make the learning material more memorable</strong> with a creative storytelling approach and inspire children to pick up an interest and learn more.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>As an educational tool, digital services can make abstract concepts more concrete</strong> so that visitors can visualize and understand them, especially children. An example would be to educate them on curators’ methods. This would help them to reflect on historical stereotypes and would involve them in co-creation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Promote dialogue and collaboration between CH professionals, schoolteachers and university professors</strong> in order to develop a common strategy on how young people should be connected to CH.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Involve people who are working with music, sound and acting to create new language for communicating with digital natives.</strong> This very much changes the perspective and can help professionals understand different formats of communication.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Explore new funding opportunities</strong> to engage young audience.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Digital Transition, Emerging Technologies  and the Cultural Heritage Sector","pageId":"5a522a8c-8908-4d4f-9085-a9034225f5c8","date":"7 months ago","target_audience":["PROFESSIONAL"],"layout":"blog","theme":"Technology","thumbnail":null,"mainImage":"https://ucarecdn.com/e415aa94-fd2a-4abb-bf20-ebbbe71ffd82/","abstract":"The digital transition is one of the EU's priorities.

This factsheet aims to highlight the main benefits and the most recent trends identified in the context of the research conducted during the ReInHerit project regarding the use of digital and emerging technologies in the CH sector."},"excerpt":"Introduction Beyond any doubt, the implementation of digital and emerging technologies, which is one of the EU's priorities, presents…","html":"<h3>Introduction</h3>\n<p>Beyond any doubt, the implementation of digital and emerging technologies, which is one of the EU's priorities, presents enormous growth potential for the cultural heritage (CH) sector. The number of museums and heritage sites entering the world of digital technologies is steadily growing due to reducing budgets, emerging multiple crises and raising expectations of visitors. This has altered their structure and has a great impact on the way they engage with their audiences as well as on the way audiences approach their culture and its context. However, may museums and heritage sites, especially the smaller ones with fewer resources, are not able to follow this evolution and still face many adversities in entering the digital world.

They: <br/></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>offer multiple new ways to connect with people and reach out to more diverse audiences by overcoming what used to be considered as barriers of physical, mental or social nature</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>enable museums and heritage sites to redesign traditional products and promote new cultural experiences by involving a worldwide network of potential visitors</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>support modeling and developing cultural services in the digital era</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>increase focus and interest on organizations’ collections</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>offer the ability to engage audience within the organization’s wall or beyond</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>provide users with high learning value (participatory learning)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>offer users to add their own social meaning</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>limit exclusivity and barriers: provide a truly immersive experience for all, including users with disabilities, minorities, young and old people, people from an immigration background, people who are unemployed, people who are economically or geographically disadvantaged, etc.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>promote dialogue between the user and the organization (a new relationship based on collaborative and strong interaction)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>foster promotion and distribution of cultural content, products and activities online</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>provide personalized services</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>help organizations to deal with the lack of exhibition spaces, considerable exhibition costs, and the fragility of some artifacts</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What are the most recent trends identified in the literature?</h3>\n<p>The most recent trends identified in the literature regarding the use of digital technologies in the CH sector are: <br/></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Personalization/Wearable Devices (create a more powerful connection between the visitor and the story)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality/Mixed reality (bringing exhibits and artifacts to life in new and immersive ways creating multisensory and multimodal experience)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Gesture Technology/Non-touch Interactives (In the post COVID-19 era touchless technologies and proximity sensors will likely gain popularity)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Haptic technologies</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Internet of Things (IoT) technology</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Mobile Technologies (web and hybrid Wi-Fi apps, mobile apps, tour-based apps, that enriche the exhibit content, mobile ticketing technology, etc.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Indoor GPS tracking systems (track movement within the facility, which allows them to confirm how well a storyline works)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>LED/Laser Projection Technologies (creating powerful, immersive museum environments)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Virtual Touring</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Holographic representations</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Flexible Technology Exhibit Platforms (developing software and designing exhibits that can not only accommodate content flexibility but also allow exhibits to easily change)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Augmented Reality Selfie-Moments</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Digital and emerging technologies and visitors’ experience</h3>\n<p>In the context of the research conducted during the ReInHerit project, great attention was paid to the importance for museums and heritage sites to interact with their visitors in dynamic and powerful ways, offering transformative learning experiences throughout the entire visitor’s journey. According to the “Visitor Journey theory” the experience of the visit begins before visitors cross the museum/heritage site entrance and goes on after they exit. In this respect, the use of digital and emerging technologies can help museums and heritage sites to offer playful and immersive experiences in order to inspire creativity not in a rigid didactic way but based on informal and participatory learning. They can engage new audiences, especially young people and local communities, and motivate them to experience, enjoy and participate in CH. It is important for CH professionals to reflect the diversity of stories within museum collections and to use digital tools, emerging technologies and participatory storytelling to promote social inclusion. Always considering that digital and emerging technology is not a goal in itself, but it is a way to make the visitor understand and learn more.</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"IP Management","pageId":"04ced4a2-0ee8-454a-9fa4-f9b604b6340a","date":"7 months ago","target_audience":["PROFESSIONAL"],"layout":"blog","theme":"Management","thumbnail":null,"mainImage":"https://ucarecdn.com/c8cf2092-cdd5-4baf-b3a4-a2b1601d147c/","abstract":"IP Management in the area of culture aims at helping museums and other cultural heritage institutions and sites to manage their intangible assets by a) securing their legal protection, b) making the best out of it in terms of exploitation and profit, and c) preventing them from infringing third party rights.

That means that any use of protected subject matter, which is unauthorized, will be considered illegal and brings with it sanctions and remedies. Yet, protected content can be used in certain instances on the basis of exceptions or limitations provided in the law. <br/></p>\n<p>When IP protection expires, protected subject matter falls into the public domain and can be used freely by anyone.</p>\n<h3>What is IP Management?</h3>\n<p>Even if cultural institutions are non-profit organizations or do not want to engage in business opportunities, IP management is essential for them to accomplish their aims and mission. In fact, it helps institutions and sites to manage their intangible assets by a) securing their legal protection, b) making the best out of it in terms of exploitation and profit, and c) preventing them from infringing third party rights. The main issues that need to be taken into account are the following: <br/></p>\n<ol>\n<li>IP Inventory/IP Audit</li>\n<li>IP Policy</li>\n<li>Licensing Strategy</li>\n<li>Digital Rights Management and New Business Models</li>\n<li>IP Culture</li>\n<li>Dispute Resolution</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>1. The IP Inventory/IP Audit/IP Strategy</h4>\n<p>For a cultural heritage institution to be able to manage its IP assets, it needs to first list and inventory them. That has a dual aim. On the one hand, it allows the institution to realize how much of the necessary rights (e.g., concerning artefacts in its collections) has acquired and how much it needs to acquire in order to pursue its aims legally. On the other hand, it allows it to make provision as to how not to infringe third party IP rights and escape liability. That is usually done on the basis of an IP Inventory or an IP Audit. <br/>\r\nAn IP Inventory is an inventory of the IP assets held by the institution, whether by creation, acquisition, or license. An IP Audit identifies the IP assets, their value and importance, and enables the setting up of an IP Strategy to ensure that the institution is leveraging as much value as possible out of its, often under-utilized or undervalued, assets.</p>\n<h4>2. IP Policy</h4>\n<p>An IP Policy assists an institution’s personnel to deal with IP issues in a principled manner. The Policy may also replace an IP Strategy, without precluding instances where both may co-exist. <br/>\r\nThe IP Policy may take the form of principled statements that work as guidelines to the institution administrators faced with decisions that involve IP issues. Some examples in this respect are statements for avoiding liability, ownership and use of self-generated IP, terms of acquisition of collections, use of trademarks and logos, terms of donations, online licensing, digitization of works, terms of access to the works/collections as well as more specialized ones by reason of the institution’s specific goals. For example, if a library, standardized terms for photocopying, lending, dealing with out of commerce books, orphan works, etc. The IP Policy may also contain due diligence steps and ‘safe harbour right statements’ to avoid liability.</p>\n<h4>3. Licensing Strategy</h4>\n<p>If the institution decides to engage in commercial/profit-making activities, it needs to follow a licensing strategy. This strategy may implement in more detail aspects of the institution’s IP Policy. <br/></p>\n<p>Some examples where a fully-fledged Licensing Strategy is required are the following: <br/></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>charge visitors for guided tours, taking pictures, videos, etc.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>operate a shop with products incorporating the image/design of items in its collections and other products</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>use of images/photographs of items in its collections by private parties, companies, other institutions, online platforms, etc.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>selling of books with pictures of items in its collection and generally making publications, selling postcards, posters, copies of items in its collections</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>use of its trademarks and logos</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>rent some of its premises for conferences together with the use of logos or for social events</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>run a restaurant, a café, etc.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4. Digital Rights Management and New Business Models</h4>\n<p>In an era of digitization, a cultural heritage institution or site needs to conform and adapt its services. This has been especially so after the pandemic where physical visits were no longer possible for an extended period of time and where the institutions were no longer accessible under the terms and conditions applicable until then (i.e., before the pandemic). The institutions realized that in order to keep up with the general pace and the augmenting needs of offering as much as possible to the pubic without the constraints of time or geography, they had to make at least their collections visitable. Thus, an institution’s strategic decisions include going digital: i.e., digitize collections, offer virtual tours, maintain a website with pictures and information, introduce licences for digital materials, ‘advertise’ their collections through world-known platforms such as Europeana, Google Arts, and so on. At the same time, taking into account that offers on the Metaverse had multiplied, institutions had to be able to compete and therefore use new technologies to respond to such a task (e.g., virtual/augmented/mixed realities, immersive performances, haptic technologies, AI, NFTs).</p>\n<h4>5. IP Culture</h4>\n<p>The creation of an IP culture is usually the goal of the implementation of an IP Strategy. Since an institution does not necessarily have an IP Strategy, an IP Policy should aim at the cultivation within the institution of an IP Culture where all employees are informed/educated/trained as to how to deal with creative content (generated within the organization, outsourced, or belonging to third parties) and be aware and motivated to apply the institution’s IP Policy concerning their part of work or role. They need to develop a culture as to how to handle IP issues according to the institution’s policies and guidelines.</p>\n<h4>6. Dispute Resolution</h4>\n<p>Engaging in exploitation make give rise to disputes. Disputes may also arise from the breach of any type of contract or agreement where the institution is a contracting party irrespective of whether this is for commercial benefit or not. It could simply be an exhibition agreement. Disputes may also arise from tortious behaviour such as the infringement of IP rights. <br/></p>\n<p>The institution needs to take decisions on the resolution of disputes whether, for example, it will resort to litigation or to Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) (arbitration, mediation, conciliation, negotiations, etc.). <br/></p>\n<p>Dispute resolution may be part of the institution’s IP Policy so that there is a uniform stance as to how one handles such situations.</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"The Cultural Heritage Sector: current needs, challenges, and opportunities ","pageId":"daef2722-2ad3-479c-83e8-7b53c20122d7","date":"7 months ago","target_audience":["PROFESSIONAL"],"layout":"blog","theme":"Management","thumbnail":null,"mainImage":"https://ucarecdn.com/5e0b65ca-32b2-4580-8eeb-21d358568f09/","abstract":"A sustainable model of Cultural Heritage Management (CHM) should be flexible in order to adapt to changes and emerging needs in the economic, political, social and physical environment and adopt new ideas and practices as a response to those needs.

The cultural heritage (CH) sector, both at European and global level, has to tackle a complex reality, with multiple challenges and bottlenecks that create specific urgent needs. The COVID-19 pandemic and the energy and cost of living crisis that followed the war in Ukraine are being the most recent examples, which have both compounded the challenges already faced by the sector and created new ones. The first step a museum or a heritage site must take in order to tackle this complex reality is to understand the needs, challenges and bottlenecks of this era. An in-depth understanding of the current situation in the CH sector will facilitate CH professionals to develop a Cultural Heritage Management (CHM) plan that provides a vision, aims and actions designed to address these needs. This crucial step will help museums and heritage sites to understand how to turn challenges into opportunities and act as a major resource for resilience, connection, recovery, and positive change, contributing to the creation of inclusive, peaceful, and sustainable societies in this ever-changing environment.</p>\n<h3>What is the current situation in the CH sector across Europe?</h3>\n<p>In the context of the ReInHerit project we mapped the current status quo of the CH sector in Europe in order to provide an overview of the current needs, challenges and opportunities. The current situation in the CH sector can be indicatively summarized as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Need for interdisciplinary collaboration so as to avoid fragmentations:</strong> The CH sector is characterized by fragmentation at multiple levels, which creates serious gaps and obstacles to the sustainable management of CH. Dealing with the inclusive and extensive concept of CH, the entire sector became itself very broad acquiring an interdisciplinary character, since it cuts across many disciplines and fields (social sciences, humanities, architecture, law, management, marketing, finance, restoration, conservation, curatorship, ICT, museology, etc.). This has resulted in difficulties in communication and collaboration between different professional experts (e.g., CH professionals, ICT experts, IPR experts, etc.). As a result of this complex reality there are many adversities in terms of how these experts engage with CH and how they can work together.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Sustainable business models resilient to changes and crises:</strong> Budget and funding are decreasing in the CH sector. Yet, financial sustainability is important for museums and CH institutions to pursue their aims and goals. Therefore, the CH sector currently faces the challenge to reassess its underlying business models. Innovative approaches to funding and sustainability are needed for museums and CH institutions to be resilient to change and crises, to promote and diversify the cultural offer, as well as see opportunities where crises lay.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Redefining the relationship between museums and their various audiences:</strong> museums and CH institutions are still facing adversities in sustaining and inspiring actual audiences as well as in attracting potential audiences. Engaging with audiences is a complex process given the fact that there are different types of audiences with major diversities in motivation, interests, barriers, experiences, and needs. Furthermore, technological achievements and the recent COVID-19 pandemic changed audience behavior, and this change requires new policies that meet these needs. More specifically, CH professionals are facing difficulties in reaching specific target groups, such as young people, locals, tourists, and making CH relevant to them. It is an extremely challenging task for CH professionals to manage the tangible and intangible CH taking into account the needs of the various audiences, using a management approach.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Need to redefine the management of collections based on evolving ethical standards and new trends:</strong> museums and CH institutions need to redefine the way they manage their collections. They have an important duty to collect, preserve and disseminate tangible and intangible CH, taking into account high legal, ethical and professional standards. Despite significant calls for repatriation and decolonization of collections, there are several constraints, differences in attitudes and lack of information that make this task increasingly difficult and as a result create gaps of understanding between artefacts and the communities/countries these artefacts originate from. Lack of resources, the use of institutional gaps and/or political will or difficulties arising from illicit trafficking of cultural objects are some of the obstacles only.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Environmentally friendly museums and CH institutions:</strong> climate change and environmental issues play a key role on how museums and CH institutions should be engaged with society as part of the sector’s commitment towards it. They are expected to operate as change makers and leaders in order to better respond to the environmental challenges that the world faces today. This is more relevant than ever, as the current energy and cost of living crisis has forced museums and heritage to find sustainable ways to revisit and adapt environmental plans, to reduce energy consumption, to improve sustainability for their buildings, and to find alternative energy sources.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The pandemic and the recent energy cost increases, a challenge to crisis management and an opportunity for digital services:</strong> the wide-ranging impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures to contain it present critical risks for the CH sector due to the intermittent closure of sites (especially in the first stage of the pandemic) and the personal protection measures. Furthermore, the recent energy and cost of living crisis that followed the war in Ukraine tends to be even worse than the COVID-19 pandemic. Museums and CH institutions are extremely vulnerable to unprecedented cost increases following a period of declining revenues during the pandemic. Importantly, this situation has heightened the different challenges faced by the sector, which now strives to find new methods of operating (including going digital, and finding alternative energy sources) and dealing with abnormal situations where normal operation is not possible.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What is the next step?</h3>\n<p>Over the coming years, museums and heritage sites are called to successfully respond to the rapidly changing reality and act timely and effectively in such a manner and form so as to respond to their social role, responsibilities and the challenges arising. CH professionals should be constantly alert and fully aware of ever-changing global circumstances. This is an absolutely essential step that helps the resilience of museums and heritage sites. The CH sector in Europe should take into account the needs, challenges and opportunities discussed above, build on the best practices of the pre-pandemic situation and the lessons learned over the pandemic, and develop a more sustainable CHM, within the context of technological developments, digital innovation and the Metaverse.</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Museum content marketing: reaching audiences effectively","pageId":"5cf56d78-39af-451d-b87c-be0cae9f4f9e","date":"7 months ago","target_audience":["PROFESSIONAL"],"layout":"blog","theme":"Management","thumbnail":null,"mainImage":"https://ucarecdn.com/f05684f1-af92-487d-8d04-dd3a200ccef6/","abstract":"During the ReInHerit interviews with museum professionals one expressed need was that of marketing skills.

You also <strong>need to understand your market</strong> and <strong>what methods to use to bring about profitable visitor action.</strong> Through marketing you can provide a framework for encouraging people not only to visit your museum once, but also to become return visitors.  It is an <strong>ongoing process</strong> that requires time, consistency and patience.<br/></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Create a marketing plan:<br/></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Start by <strong>analyzing the content you have on your webpage.</strong> Is there content that is outdated or information that is incorrect? Look at page performance. Build new content based on pages that perform well. The same applies to social media posts and newsletters.<br/></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Measure different types of metrics</strong> such as web traffic, conversion rate, brand reputation, keywords and ranking, bounce rate (visitor showing up on your page and how fast they click away), load time (of the website), backlinks (links between your site and other sites), click-through rate (shows if your post is opened).<br/></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Learn from your competitors.</strong> What type of content do they have? Conduct a deep analysis of the content they have created on their web pages and blog. What is happening on their social media channels? Do google searches on your competitors.<br/></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Understand your museum.</strong> Do this by making an analysis of your strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT analysis). This technique helps you understand what makes you different from your competition, what resources you have and what can you improve, what opportunities you can seize.<br/></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Create a set of clear and realistic marketing goals.</strong> Separate out metrics from Key Performance Indicators (KPI). KPIs are the long-term objectives of your museum marketing plan and they have targets. Metrics measure performance of smaller, individual activities (what needs to happen to improve performance such as how long a visitor is on your web page, how many new visitors visit your web page, how many visitors have clicked on your social media buttons).<br/></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Identify who your target audience is</strong> and have a deep understanding of who they are. Do research on your target audience through eg. social media monitoring, interviews, surveys, competitor analysis. Use this information to create a visitor persona, which is your ideal visitor. You can do this on a template where you can fill in information such as name, a photo (stock photo image), demographics, position (where does this person work or study), challenges/pain points faced by the person, goals, likes and interests, favorite brands, social media channels used by the person. There are numerous templates available on the internet for creating a persona card.<br/></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Create an average marketing budget</strong> – what resources are available? What do you need to spend money on? Who is involved? Are there any risk factors? What are the main actions to be taken and when? By making wise choices it is possible to do marketing with a limited budget. Focus on what your visitors want and get rid of what is not in demand, use free marketing tools, collaborate with partners so that you can share resources (a joint marketing campaign?), and repurpose content you already have in a more appealing way.<br/></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Initiate a branding project</strong> that includes developing your brand vision, your logo and brand guidelines. Brand guidelines are a set of rules for using the brand - how the logo should be used including what colours, fonts, photos and written language to use. The guidelines should also include ready-to-use templates. The brand guidelines are crucial in bringing consistency to your museum brand and making sure that all departments use the brand correctly.<br/></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Define your unique voice.</strong> This is also called a brand voice. Why? It makes you stand out from the competition. It is also a way to build trust with potential visitors and helps you build long-term connections with them. Do this by looking into what are the values and beliefs of your museum, what is your unique position on the market, what problems and desires your visitors have, what is the language used by your visitors (use similar language), what brand voice do your competitors use? Create a document of your brand voice.<br/></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Create an image bank for marketing purposes.</strong> Use a professional photographer to take high quality images of your museum and its collections. These can be used in marketing campaigns. Images of high quality communicate that your museum is quality conscious and places high demands on visuality. A visual and attractive website plays an important role to visitors.<br/></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Use storytelling techniques to build authentic connections with visitors.</strong> Tell a diverse, authentic and engaging brand story. The story should reflect the diversity of the visitor base so that it connects with visitors from all walks of life.<br/></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Make sure that your content is accessible.</strong> Follow inclusivity requirements and create an inclusivity plan for your web pages.<br/></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Plan your content.</strong> Decide what type of content you want to create, on what channel and when you want to publish it. Have a content publishing plan with dates and areas of responsibility – who will create what type of content when? Keep these questions in mind: is the content useful for my target audience? Do the topics align with themes and messaging that we want to share as a museum? Does the content make sense to my visitors? Should you have seasonally specific content, tied to special holidays or promotional periods (eg. the international museum day)? What is being discussed in the sector – can you create content related to this? Learn from your competitors – what type of content are they creating?<br/></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Create user-generated content (UGC).</strong> Use this content to tell stories that reflect the experiences of your visitors. Have UGC galleries on your website so that prospective visitors can have a peek into your exhibits and collections that may encourage them to make a visit in person. The great thing about having a UCG gallery is that your users will create content for you. This content can be both on your webpage and on display in the museum through digital displays. This is one way to foster a sense of community.<br/></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Measure what your return on Investment (ROI) is.</strong> The simple formula for understanding ROI is looking at the revenue made from content marketing and comparing it to the time and resources your museum invested in it. The aim is to track costs and benefits that your content marketing activities have generated.  Look at costs – how much is spent on content marketing? Usage – are you using all the content you have planned in your strategy in a proper way? What about performance? What results is your content marketing generating? Have you managed to attract more visitors?<br/></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"The Basics of Cultural Heritage Management","pageId":"71322f73-663b-4741-89a0-dbf19f3a6cf5","date":"7 months ago","target_audience":["PROFESSIONAL"],"layout":"blog","theme":"Management","thumbnail":null,"mainImage":"https://ucarecdn.com/02d7af43-1fe8-4264-9821-a44465a75732/","abstract":"Nowadays, the wide field of Cultural Heritage Management (CHM) is steadily growing, since museums and heritage sites (public or private, local, regional or international) adopt various approaches, methods and practices in order to redefine themselves in a constantly changing word.

It is approached as a dynamic rather than a static concept, which is constantly changing as a result of complex historical, political, social and environmental processes. The content of the term has been considered open-ended and fungible and, nowadays, has become inclusive and extensive. This approach clearly links CH to the current situation of the world making it more relevant to the contemporary societies. In this respect, CH sector as a whole has a role to play in the present and future of humanity and therefore the management of CH is of utmost importance. Since our understanding of CH is changing, the way in which we manage the various types of CH is still being defined and shaped.</p>\n<h3>What is Cultural Heritage Management?</h3>\n<p>Cultural Heritage Management (CHM) refers to a complex and changeable process through which we can manage the diverse aspects of CH, using a wide set of tools and practices including identification, excavation, recording, documentation, protection, conservation, restoration, interpretation, enhancement, promotion, presentation, distribution, exhibition, education, communication, economics, monitoring, marketing, evaluation, strategic management, ICT, risk management, law, etc. It is worth noting that since our understanding of CH is changing in space and time, and the involvement of various disciplines and fields in CHM is extensive, the way in which we manage the various types of CH is constantly defined and shaped.</p>\n<h3>What are the main objectives of CHM?</h3>\n<p>The overall objectives of CHM are to: <br/></p>\n<ul>\n<li>ensure short-term and long-term protection of CH with a view to make the utmost of its benefits for the public while considering its sustainability</li>\n<li>transmit CH values to the next generations</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Cultural Heritage Management and sustainability</h3>\n<p>At the core of the CHM should be the concept of sustainability that currently dominates the global discussion in the cultural heritage sector. Generally, sustainable development is defined by the Brundtland Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development as <em>“development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs”</em>. In the CH sector, sustainable CH is about both preserving CH for future generations and balancing and coordinating the CH needs and the needs of people who would like to experience it. The concept of sustainability acts as a framework for developing long-term strategic cultural policies and rethinking about patterns of consumption and current practices, modes of operation and managerial organization through a comprehensive approach that includes care for the environment and public health, develops practices for using new technologies and brings the concept of social awareness to the forefront.</p>\n<h3>What are the issues and principles an efficient CHM should take into account?</h3>\n<p>The first step a museum or a heritage site should take into account in order to draft a successful and implementable CHM is to understand the needs, challenges and bottlenecks in this area as well as identify the opportunities. It is then that museums and CH institutions should start to design a CHM. It is helpful if one has a thorough understanding of the character of the CH (tangible or intangible) to be managed, is acquainted with the wide set of legal instruments (hard and soft law ones) for safeguarding CH, of the resources, both human and financial, and of the relevant key stakeholders that are involved in the protection and development of CH. In this context a CHM should reflect:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>a people centered and environmentally friendly approach</strong> in order for museums and heritage sites to be able to respond to challenges and needs and to seize opportunities</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>a clear orientation towards the concepts of inclusivity, innovation, accessibility, relevance, democratisation, sustainability, resilience, ethics, diversity, professionalism, cooperation, and community participation</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>flexibility and adaptability</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>strategies accompanied by clear policies, guidelines, and a road map on strategies implementation and resource allocation in order to facilitate the success of the process</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>a clear knowledge of the application of digital technologies, methods, tools, plans, actions, etc.,</strong> which are of relevant to the CH sector.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>CHM in periods of crises</h3>\n<p>The COVID-19 pandemic and the energy crisis, which is a transformative and tough period for mankind, has paved the way for innovation and new ways of managing CH. The CH sector in Europe does not need to waste this opportunity by going back to the traditional ways of operating. Instead, it needs to build on the best practices of the pre-pandemic situation and the lessons learned over the pandemic to develop a more sustainable CHM, while taking advantage of technological developments and digital innovation. CH professionals need to go beyond existing practices of digitizing collections and find new ways to make visiting a museum or heritage site an interactive and immersive experience that engages the audience in the context of the fourth Industrial Revolution.</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Connecting professionals: cooperation and peer learning","pageId":"7a2ffe80-30b1-4843-a474-bec32ae6f194","date":"7 months ago","target_audience":["PROFESSIONAL"],"layout":"blog","theme":"Other","thumbnail":null,"mainImage":"https://ucarecdn.com/93672655-b535-4b22-9f1b-57ef06950ccd/","abstract":"It is the professionals in museums and cultural heritage sites that deal with all the multiple challenges that affect the work such as attracting new audiences, ensuring that the museum is relevant in a societal sense, getting funding for exhibitions and project work, working with communities and other central stakeholders, working with collections and research, curating new exhibitions. During the ReInHerit primary research phase professionals expressed a need for authentic, hierarchy free connections between professionals. They frequently mentioned the need to create connections between professionals and sharing information and experiences. Professionals want to learn from each other, learn from mistakes and successes, but also get easily accessible information in a simple format. Expert interviews were conducted to get more in-depth insights on the issue of cooperation. Museum professionals that the ReInHerit project interviewed provided useful recommendations on how to support cooperation between museums and Cultural Heritage sites, as well as networking between museum professionals.

Cooperation enables you to find partners to cooperate with on projects, get information on funding possibilities, get information on innovations and trends in the museum sector and much more. Working together with others across disciplinary and geographical borders is also fun and enriching for your own practice. Connections between professionals has the potential to increase the innovation capacity of organisations. New ideas are born when new combinations of people come together to discuss and share experiences and ideas. <br/></p>\n<h4><em>What types of needs were expressed by museum professionals on the issue of connection and cooperation?</em> <br/></h4>\n<p>The needs identified by the professionals interviewed were varied. Professionals wanted to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have more mobility within and between organisations</li>\n<li>Share information, practices, ways of working, experiences, innovative approaches, and information on challenges faced</li>\n<li>Belong to a community</li>\n<li>Find partners that they could cooperate with when applying for project funding</li>\n<li>Get easily accessible information on the various funding schemes that are available</li>\n<li>Get easily accessible information on on-going projects in the sector</li>\n<li>Have a place to show case, pitch, test and review new ideas in the museum sector</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><em>What can be done to facilitate cooperation between and within organisations and individuals in the museum sector?</em> <br/></h4>\n<p>Recommendations: <br/></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Start at home. Build new connections within your organization.</strong> Change roles within your organization so that you work with other professionals than the ones you regularly work with. This may lead to expanding your understanding of different professional skills in your organization and the role they play in the larger scheme of things.<br/></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Get new perspectives through networking.</strong> Connect museum and cultural heritage site professionals to each other. This enables you to see your own heritage through the eyes of other professionals and audiences in other countries.<br/></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Be pro-active.</strong> It is important to reach out actively, have a pro-active, open-minded mindset: openness to change has the potential to increase the relevance of a museum.<br/></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Change mindsets.</strong> Cooperation depends on goodwill and on a change of mindset. Museums need to think bigger and think out of the box to find novel cooperation partners like for example linking street art and cultural heritage issues.<br/></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Break silos.</strong> Get out of your comfort zone and seek out new, unexpected cooperation partners. Extend the sphere of your stakeholders, go outside of your institution, create events that link a wide range of stakeholders to help you include new stakeholders.<br/></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Find the right match.</strong> It is a matter of finding the right match (having common interests, similar research interests), people with whom you develop a good chemistry/working relationship.<br/></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Cooperate in new ways.</strong> Be ready to do things in a different way. Be relevant by expanding the stakeholder base - work across geographical boundaries and in cross-disciplinary teams.<br/></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Start with small steps.</strong> You do not always need to spend money to initiate cooperation or shared projects. Engage in joint activities such as doing a social media campaign together with another museum or CHS. From these small initial steps the cooperation can evolve into a more developed form of cooperation. It allows you to test the cooperation and gives you an idea of how the cooperation works.<br/></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Have a particular kind of leadership.</strong> Cooperation needs a particular kind of leadership in your organisation. Slow and non-transparent decision-making structures are a hindrance to the development and implementation of innovative ideas. For change to happen on an institutional level you need a holistic approach to bring about change on an organizational level. You need a change of mindset among the leadership - open-minded museum/CHS directors is key to starting to work in new ways. Perhaps the organizational structure needs to be revised for it to answer to the needs of contemporary society. Allowing for teamwork and less hierarchical ways of working and decision making is a way to support innovation work. Teamwork provides employees with the power and space to explore. It means trusting the creativity of the team and its ability to get things done.<br/></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Cooperate with communities.</strong> This requires a separate set of skills than when cooperating between specialists. What can you learn from other museums actively doing outreach work? Contact them and ask them for tips and advice. Perhaps they have a handbook or report to share. Organise a workshop or Zoom meeting to discuss these issues. Involve the community in novel ways- ask them to co-curate exhibitions. Go to where the people are to present what you can offer them.<br/></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Expand the definition of community.</strong> what community means can be stretched, it’s not even territorial. It can be the neighbourhood or the bigger picture or whatever, all those who acknowledge you and who come to you because they feel that there is a need for you and that you are helping them in some other way, that you are being of service to them.<br/></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Create synergies between academic researchers and museum professionals.</strong> There is a lot of academic knowledge out there that museum professionals could tap into and that needs to be transformed into pedagogical terms. Find out about academic research being conducted in areas of relevance to your collections or themes you are interested in exploring in your audience work. Contact academics and ask them to join discussions organized at your museum. Organise workshops to explore issues that are of common interest to you and as a means of creating a shared understanding of central themes and concepts that are of interest to you. Museum professionals and academics can create outreach programmes together to communicate what is happening in research.<br/></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Engage in peer-to-peer learning.</strong> If you have limited resources for up-skilling perhaps you can share the costs of an online course with other museums or engage in peer-to-peer learning. Do you have a skill that you can share with others? Could you in exchange get a skill from another professional that you do not have? Learn from each other – it is free and it creates contacts that can lead to other forms of cooperation.<br/></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Exchange experiences through virtual visits and tours.</strong> Connect to other museum professionals through virtual visits, guided tours of professional contexts and work place exchanges &#x26; virtual guided tours of professional contexts.<br/></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Exchange curators.</strong> Organise an exchange with another museum. A curator from another country will see your collections with new eyes and provide new perspectives.<br/></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Develop social and soft skills.</strong> These are essential when engaging in cooperation. Skills such as listening empathy and cultural diplomacy need to be developed.<br/></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Create new opportunities for cooperation through digitalisation.</strong> New products can be created such as joint digital exhibitions. Organising joint digital exhibitions opens up new perspectives on your collections.<br/></p>\n</li>\n</ul>"}}]}}}
