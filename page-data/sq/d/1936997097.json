With this web application, users can upload videos with similar types of degradation as those inherent in the system and related to aging and download restored versions. There is no need for <strong>costly and time-consuming</strong> manual intervention by experienced archivists with commercial solutions.</p>\n<p>Analog videos in historical archives often exhibit severe <strong>visual degradation</strong> due to <strong>deterioration</strong> of tape media, limiting their distribution and enjoyment by the general public. But with Smart Video Restoration these limitations are a thing of the past.
