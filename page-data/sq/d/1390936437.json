This immersive interdisciplinary experience combined a music performance by a small group of musicians from the Cyprus Symphony Orchestra, a large-scale interactive sound installation, video-art projections, dramatic lighting and a multi-sensory exhibition in the spaces of a unique monument of cultural heritage. The event was hosted at the Ethnological Museum of Cyprus in Nicosia, mostly known as the mansion of the Dragoman Hadjigeorgakis Kornesios, a high-ranking official in Ottoman Cyprus.  </p>\n<p>The entire event consisted of 3 consecutive performances with short breaks in between. Each performance had a rough duration of 40’. Interactive technology and gamification techniques were used to encourage visitors to actively engage with the space; this was a combination of a proximity-reactive audio installation, social media posts to increase pre-show engagement with the project and a treasure hunt-type mission – i.e. an envelope with a collection of written clues and exhibit descriptions - asking audience members to spot specific points of interest in the space, where sonic activity would take place. The event also hosted a multisensory exhibition specifically designed for visitors with visual impairment, which included 3D-printed replicas of some of the museum’s exhibits and a small-scale haptic sound  installation, consisting a line-art reduction of the Podocataro coat of arms (the bas relief decorating the museum’s entrance), that produced corresponding sounds when touched in certain spots, plus a booklet of the exhibition’s texts in braille.</p>\n<p>The audience and performers navigated the performance space and triggered sonic events where they entered to explore, depending on locations of sound installation receivers. Thus, every visitor received an individualised experience of the cultural heritage space, shaped by their personal choices on where to go, what to focus on, who or what to interact with and for how long, within the space, during the performance.</p>\n<p>The sounds used for each sound station of the installation (i.e. a receiver smartphone and a Bluetooth speaker) corresponded to specific exhibits in the mansion or to the surrounding space’s original use within the venue. A group of 9 musicians (violinists and violists) provided by the Cyprus Symphony Orchestra, added an element of live performance to the event. The musicians had fixed starting and ending points, with loosely set routes through the performance space. The sounds they created were produced following a set of verbal and notated instructions for guided improvisation. These sounds blended with the audio coming from the sound installation, parts of which were at times triggered by the musicians as they moved in the space, and created a fluctuating cloud of drones, short melodic motifs and noise loops that set the mood for each part of the performance.  </p>\n<p>Furthermore, visual elements were incorporated to ensure coherence between performance space and the sonic activity it hosted. These included dramatic coloured lighting and video projections. The lighting did not change throughout the performance as its function was to enhance specific spots within the performance space and to set the general mood during the event. On the other hand, the video projections used details of textures and patterns found in the venue, combined in an highly abstract collage that was slowly morphing and constantly moving for 40 minutes to set the pace of the performance. Thus, subtle changes on screen cued the musicians to move to different spots in the performance space and change the sounds they produced.</p>\n<p>The performers did not interact with individual audience members, but instead set their courses through the space and gently prompted the audience to move around and explore the venue during the performance. The musicians started the performance scattered in the mansion’s courtyard, then they split into two groups that were dispersed in the garden and in the mansion’s rooms and finally converged at a terrace at the edge of the garden to cue the end of the event. Anonymous data was collected after the performance using online questionnaires to examine how audiences interact and experience museums or cultural heritage spaces, depending on the nature of the stimulus they receive.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tZ9VoZDAsro\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","excerpt":"“ReInHerit In Performance: The Hadjigeorgakis Kornesios Mansion” was organised within the framework of ReInHerit H2020 on the evening of…","frontmatter":{"pageId":"2b2eb959-f8a5-469d-89c6-43525188aa31","title":"Overview","date":"19 days ago","target_audience":["PROFESSIONAL"],"thumbnail":null}}},{"node":{"html":"<h2>Description of treasure hunt and museological approach for Immersive Performance by Maria Shehade</h2>\n<p>One of the main ideas behind the immersive performance was that the Hadjigeorgakis Kornesios mansion would not constitute just a performance site simply hosting the event, but that the performance would merge with the place and constitute an enhancement of the visitor experience. The aim was to provide to the visitors a different way of experiencing and getting to know a heritage site, that goes beyond the typical museum visit, which is usually centred around textual ways of interpretation. Thus, the aim was to create additional layers of experience that can trigger the senses, providing a combination of visual, haptic, textual and auditory cues. This multisensory endeavour would allow each visitor to experience the heritage site in his own personal way and create his own meaning based on his personal interest.</p>\n<p>In order to allow this, the experience (both from a museological and from a performative aspect) was not designed to be linear, following a particular script, but visitors could walk freely within the mansion, deciding where to spend more time as they wished and according to their interests. To achieve this non-linear experience that would also allow an interpretation to be provided, a treasure hunt was designed around particular objects of interest that are found in different areas of the mansion.  In total, 15 objects were selected from the mansion, located both inside the rooms of the mansion and in the internal courtyard, including, a fountain, a traditional dress, a grandfather clock, a decorated chest, a tea set, pottery and jewellery amongst others.</p>\n<p>For each of the selected objects, short texts were prepared. The texts, written in simple language and avoiding academic jargon so that they were easily read by younger audiences as well, provided basic information regarding each object and its use in the daily life of the mansion. The texts were designed in such a way so as to briefly provide a general historical context for each object, since many of the objects originated from different historical periods, and also emphasised the use of these objects or stories of the inhabitants of the mansion that related to these objects. The aim of the texts, apart from providing a basic way of interpretation, was to facilitate the visitors to relate to the people that inhabited the mansion and imagine their daily life in the specific environment.</p>\n<p>The texts did not include any information on where in the mansion each object was located. They were printed on small pieces of the paper and were handed out to the audience in an envelope at the entrance of the site. This treasure hunt-type of activity was asking the visitors to spot these objects in the mansion. Each object included in the treasure hunt was linked to a sonic activity so once visitors approached an object, they would start to receive extra auditory cues.</p>","excerpt":"Description of treasure hunt and museological approach for Immersive Performance by Maria Shehade One of the main ideas behind the immersive…","frontmatter":{"pageId":"eb809866-948e-4eaa-8a4b-046d410e55b8","title":"Treasure Hunt","date":"19 days ago","target_audience":["PROFESSIONAL"],"thumbnail":null}}},{"node":{"html":"<p>The music score of the first performance was written by Dr Andreas Papapetrou.
