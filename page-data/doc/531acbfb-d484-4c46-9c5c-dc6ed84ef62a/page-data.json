If you are interested, please get in touch via the email (you find it at the footer of this page) or by contacting directly the team at the University of Graz.

What should I do?</strong></p>\n<p>It is likely that your image is bigger than the set limit for image uploads or with incorrect proportions. If so you can either resize the image or ask the team at the University of Graz to allow special conditions for images in your Hub area.</p>\n<p><strong>Can I save a CMS entry as draft?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, on the top of each CMS entry you might enable/disable \"draft\" status for your content via a toggle element (in most cases).</p>\n<p><strong>Why is my content not immediately visible in the Hub?</strong></p>\n<p>The Digital Hub is a static website, which needs to be regenerated for every new item of content. This process is controlled by the Hub admins, who perform a quality check on the content before regenerating and redeploying the new posts.  Usually, we aim to check any new content and publish it twice a week - but if you need to work with a different timeline, you can agree a specific date with the team at the University of Graz.</p>\n<p>            Usually, we aim to check any new content and publish it twice a week - but if you need to work with a different timeline, you</p>\n<p>            can agree a specific date with the team at the University of Graz.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"2024-09-09T08:17:07.248Z","title":"Frequently Asked Questions about the ReInHerit Digital Hub","target_audience":["PROFESSIONAL"],"thumbnail":null,"type":"doc","mainImage":null},"id":"0d0b593a-b2b7-5b4b-9005-2f45345f3d2b","excerpt":"What is the ReInHerit Digital Hub?
