Have you heard of prototyping in museums?</p>\n<p>Nowadays museums are increasingly seen as places of experience and dialogue. They are multi-voiced, story-oriented, open for provocation and reflection. To stay relevant and engaging museums need to innovate and have a visitor-centred approach. Developing new services and products that appeal to your visitors is vital to retain and increase visitor volumes, whilst enabling a meaningful experience. Oftentimes, though, a lack of resources is a hindrance. Development work is regarded as expensive but, is it really? This is where co-creation comes into the picture. In an environment of change and reflection co-creation is an apt, and surprisingly affordable tool to use when developing new museum products and services. </p>\n<p>The aim of this webinar is to delve into how co-creation can be used in developing permanent and temporary exhibitions. A particular focus will be on the usefulness of prototyping as a vital part of the co-creation process. Why is it useful to prototype? What do museums gain from engaging in prototyping? What do you need to start prototyping?</p>\n<p>Concept and Experience Designer Ines Montalvao will provide answers to these questions and tell us stories about co-creation processes she has been working on in museums around the world. Webinar co-facilitator Susanne Ådahl, Researcher in the ReInHerit project based at Arcada University of Applied Sciences will engage in a dialogue with Ines to deepen these important questions of museum development work.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/56da0bcf-6677-48d5-bf05-998443e23348/-/crop/789x609/0,0/-/preview/\" alt=\"Co-creation and prototyping in museums: Concepts and practical examples\" title=\"Co-creation and prototyping in museums: Concepts and practical examples\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/51c7e4b0-b67f-4d15-8ac7-395728443ba3/-/crop/795x606/0,0/-/preview/\" alt=\"Co-creation and prototyping in museums: Concepts and practical examples\" title=\"Co-creation and prototyping in museums: Concepts and practical examples\"></p>\n<h3>Speakers:</h3>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/susannetheresiaadahl/\">Susanne Ådahl</a></strong> has a PhD in Social Anthropology from the University of Helsinki and has studied Service Design at the University of Lapland.
