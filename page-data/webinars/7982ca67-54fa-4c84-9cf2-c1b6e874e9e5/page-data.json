Compassion feeds creativity, learning and well-being, which in turn contributes to a sustainable competitive advantage. An organization that encourages acts of compassion has a positive impact on innovation, collaboration, retention of staff and customers and willingness to change.</p>\n<p>Still, we know that acts of compassion are rare. In this webinar we will talk about the myths that prevent us from acting compassionately and share stories from our work and research that show how, in fact, it is difficult and even rebellious to act compassionately because if often requires that norms or conventions are broken.</p>\n<p>At its core, compassion is the ability to empathize with the suffering and struggles of others, coupled with a genuine desire to alleviate their pain. Ultimately, compassion is a rebellious act because it challenges the dominant paradigms and invites us to envision a more just world. It is a call to action, urging us to step outside the confines of societal expectations and prioritize the well-being of others.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/c3b8b906-cfac-4b01-846b-74ad9f779750/\" alt=\" Compassion is a Rebellious Act\" title=\" Compassion is a Rebellious Act\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/bac099cf-0fef-439c-a355-fc58b8e57570/\" alt=\" Compassion is a Rebellious Act\" title=\" Compassion is a Rebellious Act\"></p>\n<h3>Speakers:</h3>\n<p><strong>Henrika Franck</strong> <br>\n<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/henrika-franck-711aa83/\">Henrika Franck</a> is Dean of the Graduate School and Research at Arcada UAS and affiliated professor at Åbo Akademi University and Aalto University in Helsinki.
