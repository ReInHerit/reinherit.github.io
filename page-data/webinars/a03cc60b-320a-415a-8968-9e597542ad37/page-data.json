In a period in which museums are increasingly adopting digital tools for mediating and communicating with their audiences, aiming to foster participation and reach a broader set of publics, it is becoming increasingly important to also develop clearer evaluation methods for analysing the impact of these digital initiatives. Although digital audience research has a longer history, during the last decade – and in particular in the recent COVID-19 years – the need for clear workflows, benchmarks, and data practices to gather and analyse the experiences of online visitors and users of our digital applications has become a priority for the sector.</p>\n<p>This webinar will briefly introduce the context in which these studies have been developed and, subsequently, focus on qualitative and quantitative methods for researching digital audiences and analysing digital engagement.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/9fa48aa1-f610-4d72-8eba-b520b76aa3cb/\" alt=\"Visitor studies in the digital age: understanding digital audience engagement\" title=\"Visitor studies in the digital age: understanding digital audience engagement\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/d0bea14c-49b5-45c1-a5db-f2de2b7908da/\" alt=\"Visitor studies in the digital age: understanding digital audience engagement\" title=\"Visitor studies in the digital age: understanding digital audience engagement\"></p>\n<h3>Speaker:</h3>\n<p>Dr Chiara Zuanni is an assistant professor in Digital Museology in the Centre for Information Modelling at the University of Graz (Austria).
