In particular, the ‘Smart Tourism’ framework of the European Commission - Directorate-General for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs (DG GROW) will be presented as well as the ‘Smart Destinations’ initiative of the United Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO). Smart tourism as defined by the EC responds to new challenges and demands in a fast-changing sector, including the evolution of digital tools, products, and services; equal opportunity and access for all visitors; sustainable development of the local area; and support to creative industries, local talent and heritage.  Smart Tourism is thus closely related to cultural heritage with digitalisation in sustainable cultural tourism development and promotion. The new ‘European Capital of Smart Tourism Award’ since 2019 has components of ‘Sustainability, Accessibility, Digitalisation, Cultural Heritage and Creativity’. Cultural Heritage aspects are about protecting and capitalising on the cultural heritage, as well as local potential and its creative assets. A smart destination according to UNWTO is one with a strategy for technology, innovation, sustainability, accessibility, and inclusivity, along the entire tourism cycle: before, during and after the trip. The pillars that comprise a smart destination thus include sustainability, innovation, and technology, which are closely related to the scope of the ‘ReInHerit’ Horizon2020 Coordination and Support Action (CSA).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/afdcb64b-65bd-492a-9707-67ebb20be632/\" alt=\"Smart Tourism - Smart Destinations: Cultural Heritage, Digitalisation and Sustainability aspects\" title=\"Smart Tourism - Smart Destinations: Cultural Heritage, Digitalisation and Sustainability aspects\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/0aef9101-bb45-4d15-bac4-bd1605c5674a/\" alt=\"Smart Tourism - Smart Destinations: Cultural Heritage, Digitalisation and Sustainability aspects\" title=\"Smart Tourism - Smart Destinations: Cultural Heritage, Digitalisation and Sustainability aspects\"></p>\n<h3>Speakers:</h3>\n<p><strong>Manos Vougioukas</strong><br>\nis Secretary-General of the European Cultural Tourism Network (ECTN), the only pan-European Network that brings together the cultural, heritage and tourism sectors to work together for sustainable cultural tourism development and promotion.
