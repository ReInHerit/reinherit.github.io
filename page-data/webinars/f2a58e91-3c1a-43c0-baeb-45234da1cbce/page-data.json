The goal of “Strike a Pose” and “Face Fit” applications is to challenge the users to analyze and replicate artworks with their own body and face, obtaining information about the replicated artworks and personalized representations that can be shared on social networks.  A gamification approach is useful both for improving the skills and competencies of museum professionals and for engaging visitors in museum content through the design of playful and participative digital learning scenarios in a \"play and interact\" visiting style. In the presentation will be analyzed the technical requirements needed to develop this type of applications and the computer vision techniques needed to implement this type of interaction.</p>\n<h3>Speaker:</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.micc.unifi.it/people/marco-bertini/\">Marco Bertini</a> is Associate Professor in Computer Science at the University of Florence, Italy.
