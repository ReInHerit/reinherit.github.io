After that, visitors of the Digital Exhibitions are asked to select their current geographical location. This step is skipped in the on-site Intro, as the geographical location is preselected. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/ccd4ab37-d3fd-4e6b-94e0-85c286f8315b/\" alt=\"Questions users \"></p>\n<p>After this, the visitors answer the first three of four questions before they enter the exhibition. The questions are designed to inspire a philosophical exploration of one’s own position on aspects of the Thematic Areas. Since the visitors of the on-site exhibitions have the option of skipping the Intro and Outro, the option was also integrated into the Digital Exhibitions via a “Skip” button.</p>\n<p>At the end of both the Travelling- and Digital Exhibition, the visitors answer a final question at the Outro station. Once they submit their answer to this final question, they are taken to a map overview where they can compare their answers to those of visitors from other parts of the world.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/687845e3-1704-40a1-ae45-fdb1361b6458/\" alt=\"Map with results\"></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"2023-07-24T08:13:30.570Z","title":"Structure of the Intro and Outro Stations","license":"CC BY 2.0","target_audience":["PROFESSIONAL"],"tags":null,"theme":"Technology","thumbnail":null,"type":"exhibdoc","mainImage":null,"exhibdocsection":"Intro/Outro"},"id":"0e89791e-38d8-5fac-8165-59c8d1984633","excerpt":"The Intro station begins with a very brief teaser text explaining what the set of questions the visitor is about to be asked will explore…"}},"pageContext":{"id":"5e57b484-7bff-41dc-a9ea-9035c0bc7dc2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["132529719","1410255830","2609876834","3343622024","4136179038","4185244429"]}
