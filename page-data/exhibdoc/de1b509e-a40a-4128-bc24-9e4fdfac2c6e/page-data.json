The format addresses specifically <strong>local\r\naudiences and young adults</strong>. Digital and analogue interactive elements and a local narrative in the context of\r\ninternational history bring the exhibitions alive.</p>\n<h4><em>T﻿he Puzzle concept</em></h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/60eaabaf-d0d6-4931-bc75-6f0c60c406d2/-/crop/205x212/48,46/-/preview/\" alt=\"Puzzle concept\"></p>\n<p>The exhibition concept consists of <strong>various puzzle components</strong> and aspires <strong>to be expanded</strong>. Therefore, the already provided content (audios, texts, digital objects) can be taken up and extended with new content and objects from the respective museum/cultural institution. The exhibition <strong>grows with each takeover</strong>. In the exceptional case that an interested institution cannot add its own content or would like to show an existing puzzle element within a thematically matching exhibition, it can also be shown without its individual extension.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/87997153-68e7-4f87-9167-675b4532c5b7/\" alt=\"Exhibition stations\"></p>\n<h4><em>The Transfer</em></h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/c6774be3-32f7-4372-a86b-fe06ed65436d/-/crop/701x287/0,0/-/preview/\" alt=\"Transfer and reuse \"></p>\n<p>The exhibition will be <strong>shared digitally</strong> and the easy to implement exhibition architecture can be <strong>produced regionally and with locally available resources</strong> with the help of instructions and technical drawings. The content is stored in an <strong>app</strong> that is available for both Android and iOS. An additional web app can be used to preview the content and test the digital functions in your institution beforehand: <a href=\"https://tablet.reinherit-hub.eu/\">https://tablet.reinherit-hub.eu/</a>.</p>\n<p>We recommend using regional or reused materials when making the exhibition architecture yourself or with local carpenters. All parts of the exhibition architecture can be reused or repurposed in many ways afterwards.</p>\n<p>If the exhibition is organised in the vicinity of one of the three museums, the furniture or parts of it can also travel.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"2023-08-07T10:28:48.582Z","title":"0.
