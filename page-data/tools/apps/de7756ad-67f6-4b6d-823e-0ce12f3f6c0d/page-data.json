Once all the poses have been matched, the application allows the user to <strong>generate</strong> a video that can be saved for any <strong>social sharing</strong> and provide info on the artworks. The video shows the user matching process and the overall <strong>interactive experience</strong> lived at the museum.</p>\n<p>As part of the ReinHerit Toolkit, the application is designed for the cultural heritage domain and exploit gamification techniques in order to <strong>improve enjoyment and learning</strong> of museum artworks.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/e374f086-8574-47ba-be80-b9afedbdb597/\" alt=\"Strike a Pose - User Interaction during a test at ACM Multimedia 2022\" title=\"Strike a Pose - User Interaction during a test at ACM Multimedia 2022\"></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Strike a Pose - User Interaction during a test at ACM Multimedia 2022</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/a702cece-212f-4ab9-89b0-b67ebccae21a/\" alt=\"Strike a Pose - User Interaction during a test\" title=\"Strike a Pose - User Interaction during a test\"></p>\n<p>The innovative application promotes a user-centred and <strong>gamification</strong> approach, a process of exploiting game strategies and dynamics in non-game scenarios. It has already been proved to be useful to enhance skills and competences in a variety of domains such as marketing, industry training and entertainment. Also cultural heritage can benefit from a gamification approach which represents an opportunity to <strong>engage visitors</strong> to museums contents through the design of more entertaining, social and challenging digital learning scenarios, to help museums to move from the traditional “look and do not touch” toward a “play and interact” approach.</p>\n<p>This app won a <strong>Best Demo Honorable Mention award</strong> at ACM Multimedia 2022, the foremost conference on multimedia.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/a1fde0c2-d8f2-43bd-99d8-920f0df0a0af/\" alt=\"Best Demo Honorable Mention award at ACM Multimedia 2022\" title=\"Best Demo Honorable Mention award at ACM Multimedia 2022\"></p>\n<p>The application has been developed in JavaScript on the client side and in Python on the server side. Pose detection on the human bodies is achieved using TensorflowJS 1 detection API exploiting the pose detection model, MoveNet. The model runs completely client-side in the browser. Server-side an SQLLite database is used to stores artworks’collections, challenges and artworks’ metadata and descriptions.</p>\n<p><strong>Free Codes of the App are available here:</strong><br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/ReInHerit/strike-a-pose\">https://github.com/ReInHerit/strike-a-pose</a></p>\n<pre><code>&#x3C;iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FReInHerit%2Fposts%2Fpfbid036pzP3F1Zk8fnKBLRCoczrCUrEQVhnx6LChd2uobTdHsWWduGXNkszQwfduRsHWvnl&#x26;show_text=true&#x26;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"797\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share\">&#x3C;/iframe>\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>&#x3C;iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FReInHerit%2Fposts%2Fpfbid02nj3YC2dQEfojhFMKgxVC2xanRkVa5kbCKe3DjcQWcAztCjGFCiiXXCjAfi4cr6AYl&#x26;show_text=true&#x26;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"797\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share\">&#x3C;/iframe>\n</code></pre>\n<p>\n        <div class=\"embedVideo-container\">\n            <iframe\n              title=\"\"\n              width=\"560\"\n              height=\"316\"\n              src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GHgBIRXqKK8?rel=0\"\n              class=\"embedVideo-iframe\"\n              style=\"border:0\"\n              \n              loading=\"eager\"\n              allowfullscreen\n\t      sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups\"\n            ></iframe>\n        </div></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"February 06, 2023","title":"Strike a Pose","mainReference":"","type":"toolapp","theme":null,"target_audience":["VISITOR","PROFESSIONAL"],"linkedWebinars":["034cd93b-1043-42e9-9f2a-835d03a4e1cc____Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision for Cultural Heritage","f2a58e91-3c1a-43c0-baeb-45234da1cbce____Engaging Museum Visitors with Gamification Apps"],"linkedToolkitComponents":null,"linkedToolkitApps":null,"desc":"ReiInHerit Toolkit | Strike a Pose App"},"id":"71ac7ed4-7b64-5036-9da4-04145c935d3c","excerpt":"Strike a Pose Strike-a-pose is a web application based on Artificial Intelligenge and Computer Vision, which performs analysis and…"}},"pageContext":{"id":"de7756ad-67f6-4b6d-823e-0ce12f3f6c0d"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
