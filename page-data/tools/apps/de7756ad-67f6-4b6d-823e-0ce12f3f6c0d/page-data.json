Once all the poses have been matched, the application allows the user to <strong>generate</strong> a video that can be saved for any <strong>social sharing</strong> and provide info on the artworks. The video shows the user matching process and the overall <strong>interactive experience</strong> lived at the museum.</p>\n<p><strong>User</strong> is able to <strong>create a room</strong> by selecting the number of participants (clients) i.e. whether to interact alone (Solo) or a challange with another user (Versus), setting the number of poses the number of rounds and the level of half bust or full body of the artwork. Once the room is created, user can share the id number to invite participants.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/4d670441-12f0-453f-ab43-8f0a3251f77c/\" alt=\"Strike a Pose - Setting the room\" title=\"Strike a Pose - Setting the room\"></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Strike a Pose - Setting the room</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As part of the ReinHerit Toolkit, the application is designed for the cultural heritage domain and exploit gamification techniques in order to <strong>improve enjoyment and learning</strong> of museum artworks.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/e374f086-8574-47ba-be80-b9afedbdb597/\" alt=\"Strike a Pose - User Interaction during a test at ACM Multimedia 2022\" title=\"Strike a Pose - User Interaction during a test at ACM Multimedia 2022\"></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Strike a Pose - User Interaction during a test at ACM Multimedia 2022</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/a702cece-212f-4ab9-89b0-b67ebccae21a/\" alt=\"Strike a Pose - User Interaction during a test\" title=\"Strike a Pose - User Interaction during a test\"></p>\n<p>The innovative application promotes a user-centred and <strong>gamification</strong> approach, a process of exploiting game strategies and dynamics in non-game scenarios. It has already been proved to be useful to enhance skills and competences in a variety of domains such as marketing, industry training and entertainment. Also cultural heritage can benefit from a gamification approach which represents an opportunity to <strong>engage visitors</strong> to museums contents through the design of more entertaining, social and challenging digital learning scenarios, to help museums to move from the traditional “look and do not touch” toward a “play and interact” approach.</p>\n<p>This app won a <strong>Best Demo Honorable Mention award</strong> at ACM Multimedia 2022, the foremost conference on multimedia.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/a1fde0c2-d8f2-43bd-99d8-920f0df0a0af/\" alt=\"Best Demo Honorable Mention award at ACM Multimedia 2022\" title=\"Best Demo Honorable Mention award at ACM Multimedia 2022\"></p>\n<h2>Discover and test</h2>\n<p><strong>Demo</strong> is available at this link:<br>\n<a href=\"https://reinherit-strike-a-pose.herokuapp.com/\">https://reinherit-strike-a-pos​e.herokuapp.com/</a></p>\n<p>\n        <div class=\"embedVideo-container\">\n            <iframe\n              title=\"\"\n              width=\"560\"\n              height=\"316\"\n              src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GHgBIRXqKK8?rel=0\"\n              class=\"embedVideo-iframe\"\n              style=\"border:0\"\n              \n              loading=\"eager\"\n              allowfullscreen\n\t      sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups\"\n            ></iframe>\n        </div></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"February 06, 2023","title":"Strike a Pose - Description","mainReference":null,"type":"toolapp","theme":null,"target_audience":["VISITOR"],"linkedWebinars":["034cd93b-1043-42e9-9f2a-835d03a4e1cc____Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision for Cultural Heritage","f2a58e91-3c1a-43c0-baeb-45234da1cbce____Engaging Museum Visitors with Gamification Apps","7982ca67-54fa-4c84-9cf2-c1b6e874e9e5____ Compassion is a Rebellious Act"],"linkedToolkitComponents":null,"linkedToolkitApps":null,"desc":"ReiInHerit Toolkit | Strike a Pose App","pdf":null,"thumbnail":"https://ucarecdn.com/021b57b5-1152-4f4e-9a6f-b8fadbfc8174/","chatApps":"https://reinherit.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/392282-ReInHerit-Applications-and-Toolkit/topic/Strike.20a.20pose"},"id":"5b987305-c071-5ea5-a37d-2f0e4db5ed59","excerpt":"Strike a Pose Strike-a-pose is a web application based on Artificial Intelligenge and Computer Vision, which performs analysis and…"}},"pageContext":{"id":"de7756ad-67f6-4b6d-823e-0ce12f3f6c0d"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
