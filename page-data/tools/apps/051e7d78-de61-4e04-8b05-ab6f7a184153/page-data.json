It has already been proved to be useful to enhance skills and competences in a variety of domains such as marketing, industry training and entertainment. Also cultural heritage can benefit from a gamification approach which represents an opportunity to <strong>engage visitors</strong> to museums contents through the design of more entertaining, social and challenging digital learning scenarios, to help museums to move from the traditional “look and do not touch” toward a “play and interact” approach.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/32825610-84b5-43d2-a102-25dedd04a195/\" alt=\"Face-Fit - User Interaction during a test at ACM Multimedia 2022\" title=\"Face-Fit - User Interaction during a test at ACM Multimedia 2022\"></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Face-Fit - User Interaction during a test at ACM Multimedia 2022</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This app won a <strong>Best Demo Honorable Mention award</strong> at ACM Multimedia 2022, the foremost conference on multimedia.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/1b08d165-c701-4ffd-9859-c9246928c3c7/\" alt=\"Best Demo Honorable Mention award at ACM Multimedia 2022\" title=\"Best Demo Honorable Mention award at ACM Multimedia 2022\"></p>\n<p><strong>Face-Fit</strong> is an application developed in JavaScript and Python which provides gamification and personalization on painting, in particular portraits, adapting their visual content.
