In the development of the ReInHerit toolkit we used it in two ways:</p>\n<p><strong>Mobile applications</strong>: TensorFlow provides several tools and libraries that can help you build machine learning models for mobile devices. For example, TensorFlow Lite is a lightweight version of TensorFlow designed for mobile and embedded devices. It allows you to run trained TensorFlow models on mobile devices with low computational resources. We used it in the <strong>Smart Tourism app</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Web applications</strong>: TensorFlow can be used to build machine learning models that run in the browser using JavaScript. TensorFlow.js is a JavaScript library that allows you to run TensorFlow models in the browser or in Node.js. We used it for <strong>Face-fit, Strike-a-pose and Smart Lens apps</strong>.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 17, 2023","title":"Tensorflow Framework","mainReference":null,"type":"toolcomponent","theme":null,"target_audience":["PROFESSIONAL"],"linkedWebinars":null,"linkedToolkitComponents":null,"linkedToolkitApps":["437c8b14-f2c8-4fe6-9162-104d4abbb5b6____Smart Tourism App","de7756ad-67f6-4b6d-823e-0ce12f3f6c0d____Strike a Pose Description","7ae4d04e-fc32-48b0-b2fe-6c035d28bde8____Face-Fit","beae4f2a-8f09-4de1-949a-398f8b3626b3____Smart Lens"],"desc":"Tensorflow is a deep learning framework used in several apps of the ReInHerit Toolkit","pdf":null,"thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Tensorflow_logo.svg/224px-Tensorflow_logo.svg.png"},"id":"9b7ede12-eec3-5d90-ba70-6e6638224af4","excerpt":"TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google.
