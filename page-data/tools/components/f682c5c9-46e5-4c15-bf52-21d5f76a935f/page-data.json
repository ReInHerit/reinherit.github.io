It is a Python-based scientific computing package that allows you to build and train machine learning models for various tasks, such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and robotics.</p>\n<p>PyTorch is based on the idea of dynamic computation graphs, which means that the graph is constructed on the fly during the forward pass of the model. This allows for more flexibility and easier debugging compared to static computation graphs used in other frameworks like TensorFlow. With dynamic computation graphs, you can use Python control flow statements, such as loops and conditionals, to build complex models.</p>\n<p>This framework has been used in several apps of the ReInHerit toolkit, typically those where the backend provides the main deep learning functionalities such as <strong>Smart Video Restoration</strong>, <strong>Smart Retrieval</strong> and the <strong>Multimedia Chatbot</strong>.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 17, 2023","title":"PyTorch Framework","mainReference":null,"type":"toolcomponent","theme":null,"target_audience":["PROFESSIONAL"],"linkedWebinars":null,"linkedToolkitComponents":null,"linkedToolkitApps":["c01cc7e5-033c-4d07-a56f-4612f9f210b3____Multimedia Chatbot","b17b98c2-fa69-49e0-99e2-0c6111e3ca81____Smart Video Restoration","e4a4ac1e-aa66-4664-a582-4055a3138d66____Smart Retrieval"],"desc":"The PyTorch framework has been used in several apps of the ReInHerit Toolkit","pdf":null,"thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/Pytorch_logo.png","chatApps":null},"id":"69a16325-2755-5263-99a0-a9a631c0c89c","excerpt":"PyTorch is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Facebook's AI research team.
