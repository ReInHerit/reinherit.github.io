They want to know how the city is subjectively perceived and experienced. And the best people to answer this are Frankfurters themselves, of course. Using different methods in participative city research, the City Lab is always on the move and invites the people to join new exhibition and event formats regularly.

In this permanently installed City Lab, things can be stored and examined better than out in the field – in other words, different research and experiments can be carried out.</li>\n<li>Digital CityLab\r\nDigital City Lab is a website that has transferred the City Lab concept to a digital platform for users. The user space is a digital map of the city on which places can be marked and expanded with the stories and knowledge of Frankfurters. The users can tell their stories digitally with video and audio contributions, photos and texts. It’s all about collecting experiences, personal stories, special relationships with particular places, different ways of using the city together and about data that opens up new perspectives. The focus is on depicting polyphony: the plan is to build an audio-visual, multi-perspective and ever-changing city portrait shaped by user contributions.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/f213517d-5760-447a-b3b3-7e44ff2e0fd6/\" alt=\"\"></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"CityLab and digital CityLab ","date":"2023-12-06T15:23:48.158Z","target_audience":["PROFESSIONAL","VISITOR"],"pageId":"ca38f913-edb8-4eda-b18e-c6687601c63d","license":"CC BY 2.0","thumbnail":"https://ucarecdn.com/7fa09360-f317-44bf-9350-527d49a17cc9/","abstract":null,"challengesbestpractice":"In order to enable participation, the opening of the museum, the democratization of knowledge and knowledge transfer at eye level, a museum must give up its sovereignty of interpretation and engage with the knowledge and experiences of others.
