By creating and supporting cultural routes programmes, such as the Cultural Routes of the Council of Europe, there are achievements of promoting, preserving and understanding history of different regions and countries through inter-regional exchange of people, ideas and cultures. Cultural Routes of the Council of Europe have been established since 1987, stressing the importance of European identities. The Enlarged Partial Agreement (EPA) currently comprises 45 routes contributing to protection and development of natural and cultural heritage. Cultural Routes are used as powerful tools to promote and preserve EU’s shared and diverse cultural identities. Cultural Routes provide a better understanding of the history of Europe through interregional exchanges of people, ideas and cultures. They are a model for grassroots cultural co-operation, providing important lessons about identity and citizenship. Cultural Routes combine tangible and intangible heritage, illustrating and celebrating the exchanges, cultures and traditions that have shaped Europe over the millennia. Cultural Routes are instrumental in the European context, by promoting common European identity, deploying heritage and traversing borders for cultural tourism. In a very recent development (November 2021) the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) and the Council of Europe work together to develop the opportunities tourism offers to local communities and to enhance the tourist experience along the European region’s Cultural Routes. The joint actions are aimed at recognizing the added value that Cultural Routes offer for sustainable tourism development, cultural heritage safeguarding and intercultural dialogue. The collaboration also further highlights the Cultural Routes’ potential for advancing social, economic and cultural development, benefitting both Europe and its partner countries by strengthening cultural and historical ties.
