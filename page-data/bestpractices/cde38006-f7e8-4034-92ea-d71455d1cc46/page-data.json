However, the Climate House offers more than just the exhibitions.\r\nIt is also involved in research on its eponymous topic, serves as an event location and has offers for educators, schools and kindergartens, as well as enough animals to be officially designated as a zoo. The climate house is also an extracurricular learning location for different age groups.</p>\n<p>The main exhibition is “The Journey,” where visitors move around the world along the 8th degree of longitude. The journey takes you through Switzerland, Sardinia, Niger, Cameroon, Antarctica, Samoa, Alaska and the Marsh Island Langeneß and ends where it began: in Bremerhaven.</p>\n<p>At each station, visitors learn interesting facts about the geography, culture, biosphere and climate of the place. Each area is air-conditioned and adjusted to the average temperatures of the countries represented. The wildlife ranges from tropical fish to monitor lizards. The experience center is part of the European Stud Book Program.\r\nThe culture is represented by locals from the different places, so visitors learn more about the culture and customs of these people.</p>\n<p>The second exhibition is called “Perspectives”. Visitors can learn everything from the natural process of switching between warm and cold states in our climate to the effects of the man-made climate change we are currently experiencing in this exhibition area. Visitors can learn more about research on this topic using ice core samples, fossils and tree rings. Stations offer audio, video and even microscopes to see the change for yourself.</p>\n<p>Construction of the next spectacular exhibition area has begun in the Klimahaus Bremerhaven. The focus of “weather extremes” is on the drastic changes as a result of climate change. The interactive exhibition spans three floors and will open in March 2024.</p>\n<p>\n        <div class=\"embedVideo-container\">\n            <iframe\n              title=\"\"\n              width=\"560\"\n              height=\"316\"\n              src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qo0oMD4ndx0?rel=0\"\n              class=\"embedVideo-iframe\"\n              style=\"border:0\"\n              \n              loading=\"eager\"\n              allowfullscreen\n\t      sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups\"\n            ></iframe>\n        </div></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/964db568-1f31-46c6-8204-92a5a3586a0d/\" alt=\"\"></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Climate House: a unique exhibition on the topic of climate, climate change and climate adaptation","date":"2024-02-26T15:03:08.692Z","target_audience":["PROFESSIONAL","VISITOR"],"pageId":"cde38006-f7e8-4034-92ea-d71455d1cc46","license":"CC BY 2.0","thumbnail":"https://ucarecdn.com/e2411bca-798c-4345-ac5b-fc042a8d14b7/","abstract":null,"challengesbestpractice":"The Climate House faces various challenges that impact both operations and educational goals. A key challenge is securing sufficient financial resources for the ongoing operation and further development of the exhibition. The timeliness and relevance of the information provided about climate change requires continuous adaptation to the latest scientific research. Long-term visitor interest and retention are central to the success of the Climate House and require the continuous development of engaging programs and activities. Clearly communicating complex climate issues to visitors of different age groups represents another challenge. In addition, as an environmental protection facility, the Climate House itself must implement sustainable practices, from energy supply to waste disposal. The integration of new technologies and adaptation to technological change are also important in order to maintain the climate house's ability to innovate. Successfully addressing these challenges requires a holistic and coordinated approach, involving various disciplines and interest groups.","desc":"\"The Climate House offers visitors a variety of opportunities to get to know, experience and understand the causes, effects and consequences of the climate change that is currently taking place. The Climate House is also involved in scientific research, education and various other projects related to sustainability, climate and related policies.","formtypbestpractice":"Environmental and Climate change concerns","infosbestpractice":"n/a","keywordsbestpractice":"technology, smart, climate change and adaption, tourism, sustainable, future, energy efficiency, climate experience, awareness, education","locationbestpractice":"Bremerhaven, Germany","orgbestpractice":"Climate House Bremerhaven","partnerbestpractice":"ECTN","resourcesbestpractice":"As an interactive exhibition area for climate zones, the Exhibition requires an efficient resource infrastructure. The physical structure ensures climate control through special construction methods and materials. The energy supply combines renewable and conventional sources with energy-saving technologies. The heating, ventilation and air conditioning system are central. Interactive displays,multimedia presentation technologies realize the exhibition contents. Sustainable water management, waste reduction and recycling are integrated. The qualified staff and financial resources, including construction and operating costs, are in place. Visitor interaction, security and comprehensive sustainability considerations are key elements. Identified challenges are addressed to position as a sustainable, interactive and informative facility.","successbestpractice":"The success of the Climate House lies in education and information about climate change, based on scientific findings. It acts as a tourist attraction, promotes educational programs, emphasizes sustainability aspects and supports international cooperation in the fight against climate change. Overall, it helps raise awareness, promote education and inspire positive change for the environment and sustainability. In 2022, the Klimahaus received the “National Prize – Education for Sustainable Development” from the Federal Ministry of Education and Research and the German UNESCO Commission. In the “Learning Places” category, the Klimahaus received the award for its diverse and creative integration of education for sustainable development.","timebestpractice":"2018 - Ongoing","transferbestpractice":"The expansion of a climate house to other destinations requires careful adaptation to local conditions. This includes selecting suitable locations based on climatic diversity and tourist attractiveness, adapting content to local audiences and integrating partnerships with educational institutions and environmental organizations. Financial sustainability and local funding sources must be taken into account, as well as adapting the architecture to local building regulations and environmental requirements. Training for staff to understand local sensitivities, as well as an effective marketing strategy to promote environmental awareness, are also crucial. Continuous monitoring and adjustment ensure the long-term success of the climate house at new locations.","urlsbestpractice":"https://www.klimahaus-bremerhaven.de/en/ ","urlsbestpracticeTwo":"https://www.bremerhaven.de/en/","urlsbestpracticeThree":"https://ucarecdn.com/90f9fcbe-32a4-4fd4-88a5-883e97ce2a8e/","pdf":"/bppdf/ClimateHouse.pdf","theme":"Other","type":"bestpractice"},"id":"a214516a-a437-592f-b97a-a647d7f3549c","excerpt":"Climate change is the challenge of our time.
