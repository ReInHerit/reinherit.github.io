The 3-day performances are sold out every year, with high quality of performing and great interest by an international audience of holiday-makers and visitors. The event has attracted thousands of spectators over the years. The imposing Medieval Castle of Paphos under the starry sky and the beauty of the vast sea forms a perfect backdrop for opera performance. The event attracts sponsors that make it financially possible.","timebestpractice":"1999 - 2018","transferbestpractice":"Pafos Aphrodite Festival constitutes an annual cultural event organised by PAFC at the Square of the Medieval Castle in Pafos (Kato Pafos Harbor) presenting three performances of an opera work.  This event offers great potential for learning by and transfer to other regions and cities, given that the opera productions are imported from well established locations with long tradition on opera. The setting and the international audience of holiday-makers and visitors can be replicated in other destinations to enhance the role of intangible heritage in sustainable cultural tourism development and promotion.  The means required to organise such an event are: - a dynamic team of both cultural and tourism professionals - a strong leadership by local/regional authority policy-makers - artistic capacity to select the opera company every year - financial support through sponsorship and ticket sales - effective marketing, and - involvement of the local community and stakeholders.","urlsbestpractice":"https://www.visitpafos.org.cy/","urlsbestpracticeTwo":"https://www.visitpafos.org.cy/","urlsbestpracticeThree":"pafc.com.cy","pdf":null,"theme":"Management","type":"bestpractice"},"id":"f9e49ae4-c736-5735-ac4d-5a91ff8b9518","excerpt":"The Pafos Aphrodite Festival has been established as a cultural event of international recognition with high preconditions for artistic…"}},"pageContext":{"id":"9d028c63-ef17-4fe4-896b-6f0f67bb206a"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
