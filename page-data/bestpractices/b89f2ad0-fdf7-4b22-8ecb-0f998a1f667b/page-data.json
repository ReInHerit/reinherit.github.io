This vision aims to enable a collaborative network that facilitates the testing and development of the innovative ReInHerit Toolkit. In this dynamic innovation process, both ICT developers and Cultural Heritage professionals play active roles in creating usable tools. Users are an integral part of the co-creation and design process, with the emphasis on dialogue and deep understanding of their needs. Overall, starting these co-creative mediation and development processes aligns with a sustainable and future-oriented digital innovation strategy.</p>\n<p>The students' proposals, created during the hackathons, have been showcased during the event through interviews, videos and lectures at local museums. The contribution of <strong>MateraHub</strong> and the <strong>MICC Center</strong> was crucial in beginning a collaborative process with the local museum community, creative industries and technology experts. This collaborative effort is expected to continue with further co-creation events in other local museums, including the<a href=\"https://reinherit-hub.eu/news/07fa5b02-9213-449d-adf3-6e0725736e69\"> <strong>MagmaFest 2023</strong></a>at the Giovanni Ridola Archaeological Museum.

Adaptation of the Digital Hub's open-source codes, while valuable, presented technical challenges in terms of compatibility and integration, requiring some level of technical expertise. Involving local communities and stakeholders in the co-creation process posed challenges, requiring a delicate balance between different needs and expectations. Sustaining momentum beyond the initial development phase proved challenging, requiring continuous effort to ensure ongoing collaboration, participation and relevance in following co-creation events. These challenges underscore the complexity of interdisciplinary projects, highlighting the need to address communication barriers, technical complexities, and community engagement issues for the lasting success and impact of innovative digital tools in the cultural heritage sector. Despite these challenges, the ReInHerit Toolkit's ability to overcome obstacles and achieve success highlights its resilience and the importance of its transdisciplinary approach in fostering meaningful connections between technology, culture, and local communities.","desc":"The development of digital tools involves mediation between different disciplines and dialogue with users. The main goal of digital innovation is not only to provide a tool, but to promote a transdisciplinary development process. This involves promoting collaboration and the integration of knowledge from different fields, creating a dialogue and mediation between different disciplinary fields. Following this model, the ReInHerit Toolkit has been designed and tested using a co-creative, bottom-up approach. An Interdisciplinary community participated in the creation process through inclusive and collaborative workshops and hackathons.","formtypbestpractice":"VR/AR & Technologies, inc.
