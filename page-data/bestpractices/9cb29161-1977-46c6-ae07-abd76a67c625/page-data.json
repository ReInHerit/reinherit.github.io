Following a proposal to the European Parliament and Council, the EHL was formally established in 2011. The first selection of sites took place in 2013. So far 38 sites have been designated. The next selection will be in 2019.<br>\nEvery 2 years, participating countries pre-select a maximum of 2 sites. Following this, an independent panel of experts who make up the jury at EU level may select a maximum of 1 site from each country.<br>\nThe sites are assessed according to three main criteria:\\</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the symbolic European value of a site\\</li>\n<li>the quality of the project proposed to promote its European dimension\\</li>\n<li>the quality of the work plan.<br>\n<br>\nEHL sites bring to life the European narrative and the history behind it. They are about much more than just aesthetics.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br>\nThe focus is on the promotion of the European dimension of the sites and providing access to them. This includes organising a wide range of educational activities, especially for young people.<br>\nEuropean Heritage sites can be enjoyed singly or as part of a network. Visitors can get a real feel for the breadth and scale of what Europe has to offer and what it has achieved.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"European Heritage Label: promotion of European history and heritage","date":"2024-01-29T14:07:48.282Z","target_audience":["PROFESSIONAL"],"pageId":"9cb29161-1977-46c6-ae07-abd76a67c625","license":"CC BY 2.0","thumbnail":"https://ucarecdn.com/96db3a57-b2e9-4007-82ae-dc62ca2532b9/","abstract":null,"challengesbestpractice":"EHL has the potential to create new & innovative cultural heritage tourism products , particularly for lesser known destinations.
