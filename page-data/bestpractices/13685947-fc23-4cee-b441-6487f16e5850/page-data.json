In 478 B.C, locals acceded in the first naval alliance with Athens and, sometime later, they acceded in the second. Over the next turbulent times, Macedonians, Romans, ancient Venetians and Ottoman Turks were constantly using the island as their base for their conquering plans.</p>\n<p>After the Russian-Turkish wars, locals were given the right to build small ships on the island. Later on, captains were able not only to enlarge their ships, but also to extend their activity in the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. Furthermore, what heavily enhanced the development both of shipbuilding and seamanship in Skiathos, was the transfer of the main city from the isolated area of Kastro (Castle) next to the well-secured area of the port, as it still remains. Additionally, locals’ initiative to share the profits with the ship’s crew, as well as the crew’s tireless hard work, were the two main reasons behind the successful growing of ship navigation in Skiathos.    </p>\n<p>Wishing to keep the memory of this big shipping – shipbuilding tradition of the island alive,\r\nso as to impart it to the future generations, several retired seamen decided to found the\r\nSkiathos Maritime and Cultural Tradition Museum.</p>\n<p>Visitors can see and become acquainted with the long maritime tradition of Skiathos\r\nthrough shipbuilding representations, instruments and tools, shipyards and ships and old\r\npictures of shipbuilders, their activities and their creations.</p>\n<p>Shipbuilding follows maritime activity with a rich collection of instruments, maps, tools and\r\nremarkable photographs from the life of Skiathos seamen and their ships.</p>\n<p>The museum is located at the most beautiful and best-known spot of the island, Bourtzi,\r\nand in a room of a neoclassical building, the Skiathos Municipality Cultural Centre.
