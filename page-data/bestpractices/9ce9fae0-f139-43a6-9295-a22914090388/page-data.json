Collaboration a mediation between different disciplinary fields and the involvement of new museum skills and professions is an important challenge to address. Designing new AI/CV applications require a deep knowledge of technical aspects that may be hard to acquire.","desc":"\"According to ReInherit's analysis and strategy, the Toolkit's innovative and interactive tools are able to increase visitor engagement and are based on a user-centered approach.

They prefer not to download applications but to use webapps, and their use depends on their perceived benefits and involvement in the co-creation process. Despite the growing number of museums and cultural institutions adopting a digital strategy, the ReInHerit survey revealed that smaller museums still lack the capacity to incorporate digital tools into their daily activities and need updating and training on the use of innovative technological tools for heritage management.Evidence of success consists of the involvement of small and medium-sized museums a which to test the web apps pilot project and the involvement of a young audience in their use. According to focus groups conducted with museum professionals, it is useful and relevant to develop tools in dialogue with visitors. The main goal of digital innovation is to provide not just a tool as a final product, but a collaborative development process, creating a mediation between different disciplinary sectors, and inviting communities into the creation process. The ReInHerit's Toolkit has been designed and tested with a bottom-up approach, inviting users to participate in the creation process through workshops and hackathons. Three applications of the toolkit have won best demo honorable mention awards at two foremost international conferences on multimedia and computer vision (ACM Multimedia and Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition 2022). Scientific relevance is demonstrated by a large number of scientific publication related to the apps.","timebestpractice":"1 year","transferbestpractice":"\"In order to adopt a sustainable management perspective, the strategic focus of the toolkit was the development of open-source code, so as to facilitate maintenance issues and reuse of applications by different organizations.
