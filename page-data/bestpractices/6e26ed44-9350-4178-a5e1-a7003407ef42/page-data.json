The Association seeks to support\r\nthe research, educational, exhibition, cultural and publishing activities of the Museum in\r\norder to promote the ancient, Byzantine and modern cultural heritage of Volos and the\r\nProvince of Magnesia in order to sensitize the visitors of the region to history and art.\r\nThe Athanassakeio Archaeological Museum of Volos was built in 1909 and was donated to\r\nthe Greek State by Alexios Athanassakis, a benefactor from Mt. Pelion, in order to exhibit\r\nthe painted funerary stelae of ancient Demetrias found in re-use as a building material in\r\nthe city’s wall towers. In 2004 the Museum was renovated. The exhibition of the old wing\r\nwas renewed and expanded to a new wing as an additional exhibiting space, which was\r\ninaugurated in 2009. The Museum’s galleries display finds from archaeological excavations\r\nin Thessaly since the beginning of the 20th century. The archaeological collections are\r\nrepresented thematically according to contemporary museological perceptions and\r\npractices.\r\nThe Association has been very active during the European Year of Cultural Heritage 2018\r\n(EYCH2018) aiming to contribute to the initiative on ‘Tourism and heritage: promoting\r\nsustainable cultural tourism’ by involving the local host community to inform visitors. A\r\nPanhellenic Conference was held in Volos, dedicated to EYCH2018, with the participation\r\nof all the Friends of the Museums, entitled \"Friends of the Museums in Modern Museum</p>\n<p>Practice, Modernity and Reflections in the European and International Space\" co-\r\norganized with the Hellenic Federation of Friends of Museums and the, at the proposal of</p>\n<p>the Association. This conference was held under the auspices of the Ministry of Culture and\r\nSport and the Region of Thessaly and took place on 5, 6 and 7 October 2018 at Valis Hotel\r\nin Agria, Volos.\r\nThe conference was attended by the honorable metropolitan of Dimitriados, the Regional\r\nGovernor of Thessaly, deputies of the prefecture and mayors and municipal councilors\r\nrepresentatives of cultural and tourism organizations, the President of the Hellenic\r\nAssociation of Friends of Museum Associations, vice president of ICOM, and a host of\r\nworld-wide friends, simple people who love culture and teachers of our local society.\r\nFriends of the Museums from 48 museums in Greece, were among them. The purpose of\r\nthe Conference was to provide two-way communication between civil society, museums\r\nand cultural operators in general.\r\nThe acquaintance and the relations of the Associations, Unions, Associations, Friends of the\r\nMuseums, the exchange of opinions, suggestions and good practices, as well as their\r\napplicability, within the new spirit of modernity that appears in the Museum of the Future.\r\nMuseum friends listen to the modern trends and demands, through the synergies with the\r\n\"World Federation of Friends of the Museums\" so as to be able to assist, in the new\r\ncircumstances and the new role, Museums in their relations with the general public and the\r\nnewly formed society.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the Conference was an excellent opportunity for all Friends of Museums\r\nto join a cultural and entertainment visit of the local archeological and cultural wealth the Neolithic Settlements of Diminio and Sesklo, the Ancient Theater and the Palace of Ancient\r\nDemetrias.</p>\n<p>The aim of the conference was to highlight synergies of culture and tourism, to be a very\r\nsubstantial, successful and creative meeting of civil society for culture, the excellent\r\ninstitution of Friends of the Museums. Our cultural assets must be fully exploited even in the\r\ncrisis. It is our duty to preserve, save and disseminate our cultural heritage to the new\r\ngenerations. Our culture could at the same time be a very powerful economic factor for\r\nour country. In any case, it takes hard work, organization, projection, and proper training.\r\nEducation is the basis of all. Each of us therefore has to \"fight\" separately through each\r\nbody (public, private, club, cultural association, etc.) so that cultural wealth can be saved\r\nand exploited in the best way - and for the benefit of society and our economy.</p>\n<p>The invaluable treasures of our cultural heritage are also associated with the much-\r\nneeded development of our country and region, as our rich cultural reserve could be a</p>\n<p>very powerful economic factor. Our culture can be linked to Tourism, promoting it, and at\r\nthe same time giving it a particular qualitative dimension. On the other hand, tourism can\r\nbecome one of the most powerful tools for the dissemination and promotion of the rich and\r\nworld-class cultural heritage. Today's challenge is to find ways to consolidate the positive\r\nachievements, positive messages and to \"communicate\" our own unique identity abroad\r\nin a single and clear way to ensure in the long run a new position of our country in an\r\ninternational map, the complex web of international perceptions and stereotypes. The\r\nultimate recipients of the promotion of our cultural heritage are the local community itself,\r\nwe are all civil society for this reason and our sympathy is crucial to the success of our\r\ngoals.\r\nThat is why the conference was open to all citizens, members of the unions, students,\r\nteachers and all those who loved and wished to experience culture heritage.\r\nIt is certain that we will have a lot to benefit from, offer to our Museums but mainly to get to\r\nknow the Museums and the rich European cultural reserve of our homeland and, above\r\nall, the synergy of citizens and actors. We will be calling on relevant actors from different\r\ncountries to participate, since we all have to get to know Europe's cultural heritage.\r\nThe conference decided to set up a network of Museums of Magnesia and Thessaly with\r\nthe aim of increasing the awareness of cultural goods, jointly taking initiatives and actions\r\nand jointly organizing events for the cultural development and culture of civil society\r\nthrough the acquaintance with our cultural heritage.</p>\n<p>\n        <div class=\"embedVideo-container\">\n            <iframe\n              title=\"\"\n              width=\"560\"\n              height=\"316\"\n              src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nXBVvce4HKQ?rel=0\"\n              class=\"embedVideo-iframe\"\n              style=\"border:0\"\n              \n              loading=\"eager\"\n              allowfullscreen\n\t      sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups\"\n            ></iframe>\n        </div></p>\n<p>\n        <div class=\"embedVideo-container\">\n            <iframe\n              title=\"\"\n              width=\"560\"\n              height=\"316\"\n              src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JVHisW73XDY?rel=0\"\n              class=\"embedVideo-iframe\"\n              style=\"border:0\"\n              \n              loading=\"eager\"\n              allowfullscreen\n\t      sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups\"\n            ></iframe>\n        </div></p>\n<p>\n        <div class=\"embedVideo-container\">\n            <iframe\n              title=\"\"\n              width=\"560\"\n              height=\"316\"\n              src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YAGkJpJ2pLY?rel=0\"\n              class=\"embedVideo-iframe\"\n              style=\"border:0\"\n              \n              loading=\"eager\"\n              allowfullscreen\n\t      sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups\"\n            ></iframe>\n        </div></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/7d6ff321-cd9a-4982-be42-94dd062b3c26/\" alt=\"\"></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Heritage actions during EYCH2018, through citizen involvement in the promotion of museums in Magnesia, Greece","date":"2024-02-16T10:21:53.700Z","target_audience":["PROFESSIONAL","VISITOR"],"pageId":"6e26ed44-9350-4178-a5e1-a7003407ef42","license":"CC BY 2.0","thumbnail":"https://ucarecdn.com/995dc2a2-ae67-4497-a3e5-a6bf54b66c52/","abstract":null,"challengesbestpractice":"n/a","desc":"The Association ‘Friends of Athanasakio Arheological Museum of Volos’ during the European Year of Cultural Heritage 2018 (EYCH2018) aimed to contribute to the initiative on ‘Tourism and heritage’ by involving the local host community to inform visitors.
