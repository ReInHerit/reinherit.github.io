A great effort was placed to ensure that the City, the residents, businesses, and others are dedicated to smartness and sustainability. By nature people are resistant to changes, so a great effort was placed for citizens and stakeholders to convince them about the plan to accept the new way of  thinking. Human resources with expertise in all four themes sustainability, accessibility, digitalization and cultural heritage creativity was not widely available. Securing financial resources was also a great challenge since money was not easily or readily available to implement projects. Be flexible and align on the team vision and goal. Keep up team engagement. In an era with fast changing travelling habits, emerging technologies and rational climate changes, a set of new challenges faced and had to adjust the initial plans and adapt to the new needs. In addition to the above, the collection of data for creating this digital database was a significant challenge as well as overcoming the restrictions and legislations from municipalities and councils. Last but not least had to face communication breakdowns, conflicts, lack of trust sometimes and difficulties in integrating diverse perspectives. However with effective leadership by the Mayor and the Tourism Board and open communication have managed to overcome these challenges.","desc":"Pafos applied for the European Capital of Smart Tourism Award in June 2022 and was selected by a jury of experts as a finalists amonst 6 other cities.
