The overall aim is to encourage sustainable and responsible tourism policies and actions across Europe and beyond, through engaging culture and heritage with innovation and cohesion. The Charter was first launched in 2014 and has been revised as the ECTN contribution for the European Year of Cultural Heritage 2018. There is a major revision planned with several enhancements, starting in 2023 to be concluded in 2024 (10 years anniversary). This Webinar will include an introduction to cultural heritage tourism principles and practice, as well as latest relevant latest developments, such as the ‘ICOMOS International Charter for Cultural Heritage Tourism: Reinforcing cultural heritage protection and community resilience through responsible and sustainable tourism management’ and the EU ‘Transition Pathway for Tourism’.</p>\n<h3>Speakers:</h3>\n<p><strong>Manos Vougioukas</strong><br>\nis Secretary-General of the European Cultural Tourism Network (ECTN), the only pan-European Network that brings together the cultural, heritage and tourism sectors to work together for sustainable cultural tourism development and promotion.
