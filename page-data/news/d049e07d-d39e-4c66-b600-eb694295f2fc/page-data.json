This interdisciplinary performance required the collaboration of a diverse group of professionals and invited the audience to take initiative in shaping their experience of visiting the museum. The webinar will present ideas and lessons learned related to the following areas and how these can contribute to the creation and development of similar future initiatives in cultural heritage sites:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>combination of sound-installations with live music performers</li>\n<li>3D scanning and printing of objects for a multisensory exhibition</li>\n<li>touch-reactive replicas of exhibits not accessible to the public</li>\n<li>remotely controlled movement-triggered sound installations</li>\n<li>site-specific lighting and video art design and projection</li>\n<li>pre-show dissemination strategies on social media</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Speakers:</h3>\n<p><strong>Kleanthis Neokleous</strong> <br>\nDr.<a href=\"https://www.cyens.org.cy/en-gb/about/people/research-department/multidisciplinary-research-groups/mrg-leaders/kleanthis-neokleous/\"> Kleanthis Neokleous </a>graduated from the University of Cyprus in June 2011, with a Doctorate in Computer Science and has a multi-disciplinary academic background in various fields including Virtual Reality and 3D graphics, Electronic Health (eHealth), Cognitive Psychology, Computational Neuroscience, Machine Learning, Intelligent Diagnostic Systems, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical/Control Engineering and Space Science and Technology.
