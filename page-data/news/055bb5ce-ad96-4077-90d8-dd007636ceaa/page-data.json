In this webinar, we'll take you on a captivating journey through the innovative use of video games within cultural heritage institutions. Discover how video games are becoming powerful tools to engage and educate audiences about cultural heritage, learn about the process behind our implementation of the ReInHerit Museum Management game that utilizes many technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Game Engines, 3D modeling and reconstruction and see how we make this process more accessible to institutions that are interested in doing something similar. Join us to unlock the potential of video games in educating and promoting cultural heritage!</p>\n<h3>Speakers:</h3>\n<p><strong>Dr. Panayiotis Charalambous</strong> is a Research Assistant Professor at CYENS andteam leader of the <a href=\"https://veupnea.github.io/\">V-EUPNEA: Living, Breathing Virtual Worlds MRG</a> of CYENS.
