The prevalence of mental and physical chronic diseases is increasing globally. In addition, the changing demographics towards an aging population pose a challenge to health care systems since aging is associated with a decrease in physical and mental capacity and an increased risk of developing disease. Museums may be integrated into the lifestyle of patients suffering from chronic conditions due to their value in offering non-pharmacological therapeutic methods to improve the patient's experience with disease. The interactive environment of museums may have positive health outcomes not only for patients with chronic diseases but also for improving the physical and mental wellbeing of elderly and younger populations. This webinar explores recent literature investigating the effects of art-based museum interventions on (a) patients with chronic diagnoses associated with mental health and/or physical impairment such as dementia, drug addiction and cancer, (b) hospitalised patients and (b) the wellbeing of young and elderly populations.  During the webinar recent studies will be discussed which provide evidence that museum art-based interventions may be integrated as part of the non-pharmacological management of patients suffering from chronic disorders and hospitalised patients as well as for improving the wellbeing of younger and elderly populations.</p>\n<h3>Speakers:</h3>\n<p><strong>Dr Ioanna Hadjicosti -</strong> Director of the Bank of Cyprus Cultural Foundation and Coordinator of ReInherit H2020.She graduated from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece, with the BA in Greek Philology and the specialization of Classics.
