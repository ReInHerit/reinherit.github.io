It is suitable for all ages and will be presented in three different starting times, for a limited audience.</p>\n<p>The performance offers an innovative approach to the curation of the visitors’ experience within cultural heritage sites, for which we are creating an immersive experience within a museum. The performance consists of a temporary large-scale sound installation, which combines prerecorded sound and live electronics with a small group of musicians from the Cyprus Symphony Orchestra, video projection, theatrical lighting and multisensory haptic exhibits.</p>\n<p>During the performance, the audience and performers navigate the spaces of the museum freely and trigger sonic events wherever and whenever they enter to explore, depending on the placement of the sound installation’s digital sensors. Thus, every visitor receives an individualised experience of the cultural heritage space, shaped by their personal choices on where to move to, what to focus on and for how long during the performance.</p>\n<p>ReInHerit was acquired through Horizon 2020 CSA under the pillar Culture beyond borders – Facilitating innovation and research cooperation between European museums and heritage.
