They will consist of a <em>how to guide</em> for small and medium-sized museum and cultural heritage organizations that documents processes, provides instruction, technical requirements and best practices for co-creation and collaboration between museums and cultural heritage institutions.</p>\n<p>The Webinars are organised in the context of the  Horizon2020 <a href=\"https://www.reinherit.eu\">ReInHerit</a> project, that aspires to disrupt the current status quo of communication, collaboration and innovation exchange between museums and cultural heritage sites, in a sense that it will connect cultural heritage collections and sites, and present Europe’s tangible and intangible heritage to citizens and tourists in their wider historical and geographical contexts. The ReInHerit project is proposing an innovative model of sustainable heritage management, through which a dynamic network will be born; this network comprises cultural heritage professionals, innovation and cultural heritage solution tech experts, researchers, national museums, regional and local museums, and representative managers of Heritage Label sites. </p>\n<h3>About this webinar:</h3>\n<p>This webinar reflects on the challenges for museums in developing sustainable digital strategies, reflecting on the experiences of the pandemic, and the recommendation for digital heritage of the EU. In doing so, it will present an overview of (mainly) European resources to support these efforts. In particular, previous EU projects and other international portals aiming to contribute to museums' digital transformation will be presented - and the infrastructures and policies of the EU in relation to digital heritage will also be introduced. Within this context, the webinar will then discuss the resources being presented on the ReInHerit Digital Hub and their contribution.</p>\n<h3>Speaker:</h3>\n<p>Dr Chiara Zuanni is an assistant professor in Digital Museology in the Centre for Information Modelling at the University of Graz (Austria).
