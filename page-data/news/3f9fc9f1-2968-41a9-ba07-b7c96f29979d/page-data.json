What were the somatic responses to motherhood and to the irretrievable loss of their maidenhood?</p>\n<p>This online talk, organized in the framework of the European Union Project ReInHerit, will present classical Greek, female somatoform disorders, as these are described in the Hippocratic texts, vis-a-vis hysteria in fin de siècle Vienna and Paris. It examines the sociocultural contexts that gave rise to these female maladies, as well as to their medical (mis)diagnoses and proposed treatments. It demonstrates the doctors’ limited understanding of the various, dissimilar desiderata of their patients, and by extension of the numerous, unalike causes of these disorders. It finally shows how several women sufferers instinctively opted for finding ways of curing themselves.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Chryssanthi Papadopoulou</strong> was a Harvard CHS Fellow in Comparative Cultural Studies in 2021-2022 and conducted research on women’s somatic symptom disorders from antiquity to nowadays.
