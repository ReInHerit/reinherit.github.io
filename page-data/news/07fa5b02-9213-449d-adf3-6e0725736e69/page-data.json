The annual gathering, spearheaded by <a href=\"https://www.materahub.com\">Materahub</a>, transcends the conventional boundaries of conferences and festivals, fostering a rich soil for meaningful dialogue, spirited debate, and the cultivation of transformative collaborations. Serving as a guiding light for those navigating the complexities of our era, Magma Fest envisions a space where diverse perspectives converge to tackle pressing global challenges. Magma Fest deviates from the traditional event format, functioning as a safe haven for discourse and cooperation.

Magma Fest aspires to nurture an environment conducive to the creation of innovative, non-disciplinary models. This inclusive ethos encourages contributions from diverse visions, competencies, and approaches, paving the way for the emergence of unexpected solutions to complex challenges.</p>\n<p><strong>Exploration of Tourism and Technology:</strong> </p>\n<p>The second edition of Magma Fest unfolded an immersive exploration into the intricate realms of tourism and technology, dismantling these vast themes into manageable fragments of inquiry.

As a Horizon2020 project, ReInHerit proposes a revolutionary model focused on developing a digital cultural heritage ecosystem. This visionary approach invites key stakeholders—museums, heritage sites, policy makers, professionals, and communities—into an open and collaborative space to experiment, share, and innovate.  Paolo Mazzanti presented the methodology and insights derived from ReInHerit, illustrating how this initiative is poised to revolutionize the cultural heritage landscape. With a focus on the <a href=\"https://reinherit-hub.eu/applications\">ReinHerit Toolkit</a>, playful engagement and people-centered approach in Museums using AI/CV. The project's ultimate goal is to establish a dynamic platform that facilitates interaction and collaboration among diverse stakeholders, leveraging technology to preserve and enhance the rich experience of Matera's iconic Sassi.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Info: <a href=\"https://www.magmafest.it\">https://www.magmafest.it</a></li>\n<li>Blogpost: <a href=\"https://www.materahub.com/magma-fest-2023-report/\">https://www.materahub.com/magma-fest-2023-report</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n        <div class=\"embedVideo-container\">\n            <iframe\n              title=\"\"\n              width=\"560\"\n              height=\"316\"\n              src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6NqbUVsWeBg?rel=0\"\n              class=\"embedVideo-iframe\"\n              style=\"border:0\"\n              \n              loading=\"eager\"\n              allowfullscreen\n\t      sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups\"\n            ></iframe>\n        </div></p>\n<p>\n        <div class=\"embedVideo-container\">\n            <iframe\n              title=\"\"\n              width=\"560\"\n              height=\"316\"\n              src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RNoItgED5BI?rel=0\"\n              class=\"embedVideo-iframe\"\n              style=\"border:0\"\n              \n              loading=\"eager\"\n              allowfullscreen\n\t      sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups\"\n            ></iframe>\n        </div></p>\n<p>\n        <div class=\"embedVideo-container\">\n            <iframe\n              title=\"\"\n              width=\"560\"\n              height=\"316\"\n              src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TN6ONcMHXqo?rel=0\"\n              class=\"embedVideo-iframe\"\n              style=\"border:0\"\n              \n              loading=\"eager\"\n              allowfullscreen\n\t      sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups\"\n            ></iframe>\n        </div></p>\n<p>\n        <div class=\"embedVideo-container\">\n            <iframe\n              title=\"\"\n              width=\"560\"\n              height=\"316\"\n              src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/w8stRHgXKYA?rel=0\"\n              class=\"embedVideo-iframe\"\n              style=\"border:0\"\n              \n              loading=\"eager\"\n              allowfullscreen\n\t      sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups\"\n            ></iframe>\n        </div></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"November 29, 2023","title":"Cultural Convergence, ReInHerit Lights up Magma Fest","mainReference":null,"type":"news","theme":"Technology","target_audience":["VISITOR","PROFESSIONAL"],"linkedWebinars":null,"linkedToolkitComponents":null,"linkedToolkitApps":null,"desc":"Cultural Convergence, ReInHerit Lights up Magma Fest","pdf":null,"thumbnail":"https://ucarecdn.com/fd50fe57-441d-422e-97b6-993e2de3462a/-/preview/","chatApps":null},"id":"6f36991e-b0fb-5161-a953-7e513de0fa71","excerpt":"Cultural Convergence, Reinherit Lights up Magma Fest In a dynamic celebration of interdisciplinary synergy and groundbreaking innovation…"}},"pageContext":{"id":"07fa5b02-9213-449d-adf3-6e0725736e69"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
