Existing models face difficulties in accurately answering contextually relevant questions about visual content, limiting their usefulness in applications such as art learning support. Based on work conducted as part of the <strong>ReInHerit Toolkit's <a href=\"https://reinherit-hub.eu/tools/apps/c01cc7e5-033c-4d07-a56f-4612f9f210b3\">VIOLA Multimedia Chatbot,</a></strong> the demo presented an innovative approach that integrates contextual descriptions of artworks to improve the answering of visual questions, addressing a crucial need in cultural heritage interpretation. It highlights the need for chatbots that function with scientific accuracy, free of hallucinations, to provide reliable information in the cultural domain.</p>\n<p>A great opportunity to present the results achieved to the <strong>scientific community</strong>, introducing the system <strong>architecture</strong>, the chatbot <strong>dataset</strong>, <strong>design</strong> considerations, discussing possible developments and <strong>challenges</strong>, following the <strong>chatbot test</strong> carried out with the community of prominent researchers from around the world attending the Conference.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/28b6ab61-3f06-41af-a64b-8093c511b106/\" alt=\"MMSys 2024\" title=\"MMSys 2024\"></p>\n<p><strong>MMSys 2024 Progra</strong>m  <a href=\"https://2024.acmmmsys.org/program/detailed-program/\">https://2024.acmmmsys.org/program/detailed-program/</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/bed1897d-1888-4dba-aef2-88bc7def7667/\" alt=\"MMSys 2024\" title=\"MMSys 2024\"></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 18, 2024","title":"Chatbot and Cultural Heritage – DEMO at ACM Multimedia Systems Conference 2024","mainReference":null,"type":"news","theme":"Technology","target_audience":["VISITOR","PROFESSIONAL"],"linkedWebinars":null,"linkedToolkitComponents":null,"linkedToolkitApps":null,"desc":null,"pdf":null,"thumbnail":"https://ucarecdn.com/ea9602fe-8256-43a9-a9a1-1af84cd899db/-/crop/620x506/633,0/-/preview/","chatApps":null},"id":"199889ea-4046-5c59-a3d5-24ff085757d6","excerpt":"MMSys 2024 MICC researchers participated in the 15th ACM Multimedia Systems Conference held from 15-18 April, 2024 in Bari, Italy.
