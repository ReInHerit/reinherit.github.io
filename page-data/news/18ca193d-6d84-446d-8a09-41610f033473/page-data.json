They will consist of a <em>how to guide</em> for small and medium-sized museum and cultural heritage organizations that documents processes, provides instruction, technical requirements and best practices for co-creation and collaboration between museums and cultural heritage institutions.</p>\n<p>The Webinars are organised in the context of the  Horizon2020 <a href=\"https://www.reinherit.eu\">ReInHerit</a> project, that aspires to disrupt the current status quo of communication, collaboration and innovation exchange between museums and cultural heritage sites, in a sense that it will connect cultural heritage collections and sites, and present Europe’s tangible and intangible heritage to citizens and tourists in their wider historical and geographical contexts. The ReInHerit project is proposing an innovative model of sustainable heritage management, through which a dynamic network will be born; this network comprises cultural heritage professionals, innovation and cultural heritage solution tech experts, researchers, national museums, regional and local museums, and representative managers of Heritage Label sites. </p>\n<h3>About this webinar:</h3>\n<p>Facilitated by Marco Bertini from  <a href=\"https://www.micc.unifi.it\">MICC - Media Integration and Communication Center</a>,  University of Study Florence - in the webinar will be introduced two applications of the ReinHerit Toolkit, designed for the cultural heritage domain and that exploit gamification techniques in order to improve enjoyment and learning of museum artworks. The goal of “Strike a Pose” and “Face Fit” applications is to challenge the users to analyze and replicate artworks with their own body and face, obtaining information about the replicated artworks and personalized representations that can be shared on social networks.  A gamification approach is useful both for improving the skills and competencies of museum professionals and for engaging visitors in museum content through the design of playful and participative digital learning scenarios in a \"play and interact\" visiting style. In the presentation will be analyzed the technical requirements needed to develop this type of applications and the computer vision techniques needed to implement this type of interaction.</p>\n<h3>Speaker:</h3>\n<p><strong>Marco Bertini</strong><br>\n<a href=\"https://www.micc.unifi.it/people/marco-bertini/\">Marco Bertini</a> is Associate Professor in Computer Science at the University of Florence, Italy.
