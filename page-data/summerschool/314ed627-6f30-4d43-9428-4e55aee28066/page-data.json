The project proposal, entitled 'AIFOCUS', aims to merge the chatbot 'VIOLA' and the Smart Lens to create an interactive art experience that provides insights into artworks through conversation. Users can explore artworks using the smartphone camera, exploring details through the enjoyment of multimedia content. The aim is to promote knowledge among young people and trigger their curiosity about art, making learning an engaging and accessible activity for all. Users have the possibility to scan the specific details they like to explore with their smartphone camera. Once the web application is opened, users can explore and discover the complexities of the artwork. They can also initiate a conversation with the chatbot, which provides answers about the scanned details. As a case study adapted to the local context, the Matera Cathedral nativity scene was chosen.</p>\n<p>During the hackathon, professionals and experts were invited <a href=\"https://reinherit.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/395690-XR.26AI-Summer-School-2023\">to chat  via  the Digital Hub Forum</a> to support students as they work, answering questions and sharing ideas and suggestions in a co-creative and interdisciplinary approach.</p>\n<p>________________________________________</p>\n<h3>VIOLA Multimedia Chatbot video presentation:</h3>\n<p>\n        <div class=\"embedVideo-container\">\n            <iframe\n              title=\"\"\n              width=\"560\"\n              height=\"316\"\n              src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BjstSqyxbOg?rel=0\"\n              class=\"embedVideo-iframe\"\n              style=\"border:0\"\n              \n              loading=\"eager\"\n              allowfullscreen\n\t      sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups\"\n            ></iframe>\n        </div></p>\n<h3>SmartLens video presentation:</h3>\n<p>\n        <div class=\"embedVideo-container\">\n            <iframe\n              title=\"\"\n              width=\"560\"\n              height=\"316\"\n              src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ySTcIsiZkao?rel=0\"\n              class=\"embedVideo-iframe\"\n              style=\"border:0\"\n              \n              loading=\"eager\"\n              allowfullscreen\n\t      sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups\"\n            ></iframe>\n        </div></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"2023-09-28T10:07:15.136Z","title":"AIFOCUS | ReInHerit Hackathon","slides":"https://ucarecdn.com/2a04c7eb-3bf1-4f04-b7dc-25ea2d56414f/","license":"CC BY 2.0","target_audience":["VISITOR","PROFESSIONAL"],"tags":null,"theme":"Technology","thumbnail":"https://ucarecdn.com/5f63db77-7f5b-40ac-a40a-f145b6d81111/","type":"summerschool","iframesrc1":null,"iframesrc2":null,"iframesrc3":null},"id":"45f59237-664c-53bb-9a74-85d617343851","excerpt":"Project Proposal: AIFOCUS Smart Interaction and Digital Contents (AI/CV) | SmartLens & VIOLA Multimedia Chatbot Smart Lens and VIOLA…"}},"pageContext":{"id":"314ed627-6f30-4d43-9428-4e55aee28066"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
